TITLE: Exporting draw.io images to LaTeX

I discovered and tweaked a nifty one-liner which allows me to take
.drawio files generated by Draw.io and export them as clean
vector-based .pdf files which I can then include in a LaTeX
document:

  [Draw.io]: https://app.diagrams.net/

    #!/usr/bin/env sh

    find . -name *.drawio -exec rm -f ../img/{}.pdf \; -exec /Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/./draw.io --crop -x -o ../img/{}.pdf {} \;

This finds all .drawio files in the current directory . and runs the
draw.io executable on them to crop to the image and export as a .pdf
to the directory where all my images are stored ../img/.
\includegraphics{...} can then render the image in my LaTeX
document. Note that this is on macOS, using the desktop version of
draw.io, hence the funny executable.
