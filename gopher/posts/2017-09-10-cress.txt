Last year I bought a packet of micro-greens at the Botanic Gardens
and tried to grow them on tissue paper in a dish but found that the
tissue paper would dry out too much while I was out at work. I
remembered a science experiment from primary school where we grew
cress in an egg shell stuffed with cotton wool so I thought I would
try that, hoping that it would be more absorbent.

I made a bed of cotton wool in a dish about 5 cm deep, then watered
it until the wool was saturated but not so there were pools of
water. Then sprinkled on the seeds:

After 3 days they had all germinated and by 10 days they were ready
to harvest with a pair of scissors!
