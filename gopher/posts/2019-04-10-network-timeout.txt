I installed a minimal Ubuntu server image on a little Toshiba NB100
netbook I was given as a present and there was an annoying side
effect whereby if a wireless network wasnâ€™t detected on boot the
bootup process would wait for about 5 minutes looking for a network
before moving on. This happened every single time I booted up
because I preferred to only search for wireless networks manually.
The answer was to edit the networking.service config file:

    sudo systemctl edit networking.service

Then enter into the file:

    [Service]
    TimeoutStartSec=20sec

to set the timeout period when looking for wireless networks to be
20 seconds.

Check the file has the correct information:

    systemctl cat networking.service
