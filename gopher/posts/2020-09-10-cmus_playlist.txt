TITLE: Making playlists for cmus

I use cmus as my music player on my laptop. I routinely use the
track queue feature to create an immediate playlist of the next few
songs, but never got to grips with creating persistent themed
playlists. It turns out it’s not that hard, the documentation just
seems a bit sparse.

  [cmus]: https://github.com/cmus/cmus

Playlists are stored in plain text files, on my system inside
~/.config/cmus/playlists/. The default playlist (filename and
playlist name) is created by default. It’s merely a list of
filepaths referencing song locations, one filepath per line. The
filename can contain spaces and so can the filepaths, with no
quoting or escape sequences required. New playlists can be added by
adding files to the directory. An example playlist:

    /Volumes/share/music/Ben Caplan/Birds With Broken Wings/12 Ben Caplan - Canary.mp3
    /Volumes/share/music/Bloc Party/Silent Alarm/07 This Modern Love.mp3
    /Volumes/share/music/Family Atlantica/Cosmic Unity/06 La Humanidad.mp3

In cmus, it appears it is possible to add songs to the current
playlist (y), marked by an asterisk in the playlist view (view 3),
but I couldn’t find information on how to create a new playlist. I
find it much easier to create the playlists outside of cmus using a
file manager, then load them automatically when cmus starts.
