This Summer I walked the Great Glen Way, an 80 mile trail which runs
from Inverness to Fort William, along the side of Loch Ness, Loch
Lochy and Loch Oich.

The trail took me 3.5 days of walking and is one of the easiest
trail hikes Iâ€™ve done, it was also one of the most beautiful.

Campsite

[Stealth camping]


For my campsite I had a small triangular tarp that I had from some
offcuts from another bigger project. The tarp is held down by tent
pegs on three corners and raised in the middle by my walking pole,
there is a small guyrope made from paracord that keeps the walking
pole upright. I can fit about half my body underneath the tarp with
my bag and boots to keep the rain and morning dew off. Then the
bivvy bag covers the lower half of my body.

For such a light piece of material the tarp makes bivvy camping
immeasurably more comfortable, mainly because I can sleep with my
head outside the bivvy bag, even when it is raining, reducing the
amount of condensation drastically.
