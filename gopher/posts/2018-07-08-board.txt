I wanted a chopping board to have at my desk at work so that I can
snack on bread, cheese etc.

I split the piece of ash from a tangential slice of a log, then
shaped it initially using a small hatchet to take off the bulk of
the mass. Then I planed the faces with a block plane and augered a
hole in the top corner so it can be hung if necessary.

Finally I have been applying lots of butcherâ€™s block oil to keep the
wood supple and to hopefully prevent too much cracking.
