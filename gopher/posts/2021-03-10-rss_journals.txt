I use RSS to keep up with most of the media I consume, using
newsboat as an RSS reader. I use it for news, blogs, podcasts,
youtube. I also get email alerts from a few scientific journals on
their new articles, to try and keep up with current research.

Only recently did I realise that I could use RSS to keep up with
scientific journals as well. Most peer-reviewed journals have RSS
feeds which list their newest articles.

I did a quick check of my master BibTeX file to see which journals I
cite the most in my writing:

    grep "journal = " lib.bib | sed 's/.*{\(.*\)}.*/\1/g' | sort | uniq -c | sort

The top 10 journals by number of articles were, with their RSS
feeds:

-   24 - Ecology Letters
-   14 - Journal of Ecology
-   14 - Global Change Biology
-   14 - Forest Ecology and Management
-   13 - Science
-   11 - Nature
-   11 - Ecology
-   9 - Journal of Biogeography
-   9 - Global Ecology and Biogeography
-   9 - Agricultural and Forest Meteorology
