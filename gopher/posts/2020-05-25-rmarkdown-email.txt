TITLE: An email which tries to make sense of the RMarkdown ecosystem

====================================================================


I was asked by my supervisor to send out an email with some
resources to get people started with writing RMarkdown documents, in
preparation for a lab meeting on the subject later in the week. As
well as the resources, I tried to shed some light on the confusing
terminology behind the RMarkdown ecosystem.

  Hi all, I was asked to send out some links to resources on
  RMarkdown and Markdown. In addition to the Coding Club tutorial
  which I sent a link to last week during lab meeting, here are some
  other links I’ve come across in the past:

  -   A comprehensive Markdown syntax cheatsheet
  -   RStudio’s introduction to RMarkdown
  -   The definitive RMarkdown Guide, by Yihui Xie, the lead dev on
      RMarkdown

  Here are some definitions of the various jargon terms:

  -   Markdown - A text formatting standard to add structural
      elements to plain text documents, adding headers, lists,
      quotes etc.. Essentially Markdown is just a way of writing.
      Markdown documents can be written in any plain text editor.
      Markdown was designed to be read easily both by humans and
      machines.
  -   RMarkdown - An extension of the Markdown standard, adding many
      features which allow for writing scientific reports, including
      the embedding of executable R code. {rmarkdown} is also an R
      package that provides these extensions.
  -   HTML - The language of webpages. Every website you read (I
      think?) is written in HTML. RMarkdown can be converted to HTML
      webpages.
  -   LaTeX - Another text formatting standard which is specifically
      designed for creating high quality printable documents.
      RMarkdown uses LaTeX as a backend to convert RMarkdown
      documents to PDF.
  -   Knitr (knitting) - An R package which takes an RMarkdown
      document, executes the R code embedded within it, and ‘knits’
      the results back into the document.
  -   Pandoc - A document conversion software which comes bundled
      with the {rmarkdown} R package. {rmarkdown} uses pandoc in the
      background to convert from RMarkdown to various output
      formats.

  Finally, another article for those who are interested on the
  limitations of RMarkdown, by Yihui Xie: Markdown or LaTeX? - Yihui

  This email is written in markdown syntax.

  See you at the lab meeting, John
