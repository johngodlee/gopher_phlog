I download podcasts using pypodd, then I want to play the files, but
I donâ€™t want to leave the terminal. I found out that VLC has a some
command line options, including ad really nice ncurses interface. I
made an alias in my .bash_profile which starts VLC in the right way
and plays a nominated file:

  [pypodd]: https://github.com/johngodlee/pypodd
  [VLC]: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

    alias vlc="/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I ncurses"

Then in bash I can type:

    vlc file.mp3

to open VLC and play the file.

There are lots of other arguments to use VLC in the command line,
most of which are documented here.
