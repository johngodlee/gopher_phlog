TITLE: An R function to split species names

====================================================================


For my research assistant position I have been cleaning lots of
taxonomic data for tree species in southern Africa. On the surface
this seems simple, Brachystegia spiciformis gets split into
c("Brachystegia", "spiciformis"). However, what about when the
species is written as Brachystegia spiciformis var. kwangensis? Here
is a list of possible species name forms I found in my dataset:

-   Brachystegia spiciformis
-   Brachystegia cf. spiciformis
-   Acacia abyssinica subsp. calophylla
-   Acacia sieberiana var. woodii

And that isn’t counting the species with multiple below-species
taxonomic ranks, like:
Vachellia gerrardii subsp. gerrardii var. latisiliqua.

Separating these out by hand would take a very long time, so I wrote
a function which does it for me.

First the function splits strings by spaces or optionally dots with
no spaces, then it searches to see if a species is cf., meaning that
the absolute species isn’t known but a guess has been made, in which
case species is replaces with indet (indeterminate) and the species
is stored in the confer column. Then a similar process to search for
both varieties and subspecies. If below-species ranks are to be
returned then the dataframe is returned as is, otherwise the confer
column replaces the indet in species if below-species ranks are not
returned.

This function doesn’t catch Brachystegia sp.2, but I have a separate
function which replaces these with Brachystegia indet based on a
lookup table supplied by the user.

    #' Split full species name into genus, species, and optionally below-species taxonomic ranks
    #'
    #' @param x vector of genus and species names
    #' @param subsp logical, should lower taxonomic ranks be returned?
    #'
    #' @return dataframe of character vectors with one column per rank
    #'
    #' @export
    #'
    splitSpecies <- function(x, subsp = TRUE) {
      x <- strsplit(x, " |[a-z]\\.[a-z]")

      x <- lapply(x, function(y) {
        # genus
        genus <- y[1]

        # cf and species 
        if (grepl("cf(\\.)?", y[2])) {
          species <- "indet"
          cf <- y[3]
          plus <- 1
        } else {
          species <- y[2]
          cf <- NA_character_
          plus <- 0
        }

        if (!is.na(y[3+plus])) {
          sub_string <- paste(y[(3+plus):length(y)], collapse = " ")

          # variety if present
          if (grepl("var(\\.)?", sub_string)) {
            string <- strsplit(sub_string, " ")
            variety <- string[[1]][which(grepl("var(\\.)", string[[1]])) + 1]
          } else {
            variety <- NA_character_
          }

          # subspecies if present
          if (grepl("subs(p)?(\\.)?", sub_string)) {
            string <- strsplit(sub_string, " ")
            subspecies <- string[[1]][which(grepl("subs(p)?(\\.)?", string[[1]])) + 1]
          } else {
            subspecies <- NA_character_
          }
          c(genus, species, cf, subspecies, variety)
        } else {
          c(genus, species, cf, NA_character_, NA_character_)
        }
      })

      out <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, x))
      names(out) <- c("genus", "species", "confer", "subspecies", "variety")[1:length(out)]

      # Replace cf. as species is subsp. == FALSE
      if (subsp) {
        out <- out
      } else {
        out$species[!is.na(out$confer)] <- out$confer[!is.na(out$confer)]
        out <- out[,c("genus", "species")]
      }
      return(out)
    }
