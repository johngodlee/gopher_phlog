TITLE: Email about estimating competition with basal area

I was thinking about how to estimate competition in a woodland plot,
without using geo-referenced tree locations. This email goes through
some thoughts I had on why plot-level basal area isn’t a good way to
estimate competition.

  Hi, I’ve been thinking more about this situation of estimating
  competition using plot-level basal area. It doesn’t sit right with
  me. It appears to me that two plots could have identical basal
  areas but different levels of competition between individuals.
  Below are two examples which I’m tentatively putting forward to
  demonstrate my point. You might disagree with my reasoning, and
  I’m open to being corrected.

  Imagine two plots of identical area, and identical plot-level
  basal area, 5 m^2 ha^-1, for example. The number of trees varies
  between plots, however. In order to achieve identical plot-level
  basal areas the basal areas of individual trees must be different
  between plots. In plot A there are 50 trees, each with a basal
  area of 0.1 m^2. In plot B there are 100 trees with basal areas of
  0.05 m^2. Despite having identical plot-level basal areas, in plot
  A competition will be lower than plot B, because the trees are not
  as close together and therefore crown and root interaction will
  decrease. Previous work has shown that basal area doesn’t have a
  linear relationship with crown area, it’s more like a sigmoid
  curve or a saturating curve, the key takeaway being that in a
  small tree, unit increase in basal area will lead to a greater
  increase in crown area than a unit increase in a large tree. I
  think including stem density in the model could do a better job of
  estimating competition than plot-level basal area.

  Next, imagine two other plots, both of which have 100 trees,
  arranged in an evenly spaced grid pattern. In plot A, all trees
  have a basal area of 0.05 m^2, while in plot B half the trees have
  a basal area of 0.01 m^2 and half have a basal area of 0.09 m^2.
  Both plots have a basal area of 5 m^2, but plot B will have weaker
  crown competition interactions than plot A. The reason being that
  the large trees in plot B will not be negatively affected by the
  presence of the smaller trees. In this scenario, I think including
  information on the variance of basal area (or should it be area
  under the distribution of basal area?) within a plot might improve
  estimates of competition. I would expect a higher variance of
  basal area would cause lower overall competition, due to
  diminished plot-level competition interactions, but I’m less
  certain on this.

  Let me know what you think to the above points if you want to take
  the discussion further. It’s a shame we don’t have more plots with
  X-Y coordinates for individual trees. There’s a tonne of very
  convincing research on methods to estimate neighbourhood
  competition in forestry.

Thinking about it more, it may be useful to weight the competition
contribution of individuals based on their basal area. Weight the
competitive contribution of large trees vs. small trees. I would
expect large trees to exert a greater competitive effect than small
trees. Maybe the weighting should be based on pairwise comparisons
of basal area among all trees in the plot? A positive competition
effect would result between a pair if individual A was larger than
individual B, and increase positively the larger individual A was
than individual B.
