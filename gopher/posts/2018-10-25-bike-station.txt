TITLE: Fixing up an Emmelle Diamond 5 bike

====================================================================


One of our friends found a beaten up Ladies racing bike at his work.
It’s an Emmelle Diamond 5, with 26 inch wheels and a step through
frame. It had lost it’s front wheel and front brake, everything was
rusty, and the rubber on the remaining tyre had perished.

We took the bike to a place in Edinburgh called The Bike Station,
which has bike stands which you can hire by the house and lots of
second hand bike parts for reasonably cheap. We got set up and did a
number of things:

-   New front wheel
-   New front and back tyres and inner tubes
-   New front brake and cabling
-   New front brake blocks
-   Re-indexed the gears
-   Polished the chrome on the mudguards, pedals etc.
-   Reset the brakes

Now it looks really smart, thought I’m still slightly worried about
the brakes, they seemed a bit mushy, probably the brake levers.
