TITLE: An email about hemispherical photography

This is a transcript of an email conversation with a colleague that
I had about hemispherical photography and the various merits of
different methods. I thought the content was useful and wanted to
record it so I’ve put it up here. I’ve cleaned up the email a tiny
bit, just to make things clearer.

Colleague’s email

  Dear John,

  My supervisor suggested that I get in contact regarding your
  knowledge of a new hemispherical camera that she thinks you’re
  using in your research. I’m not sure if it’s the tool for the job,
  but I’m trying to map the canopy cover of a very small area of
  woodland in the Scottish Borders.

  One part of my PhD research is looking at the influence of this
  strip of mixed woodland on downslope soil moisture and groundwater
  dynamics, so I’m mainly gathering sub-surface data on a transect
  across the woodland. However, I also need to estimate canopy cover
  in summer/winter as well as the extent of shading on the land
  either side of the woodland.

  I’m a geologist, not and ecologist, and I’m sure there are
  standard methods for doing this, so if you have any thoughts
  either using the hemispherical camera or other methods, I’d be
  interested in any quick thoughts that you have.

  Best wishes,

My reply

  Hi,

  Yep I got some money from the School last semester to buy some
  hemispherical photography gear for the equipment store, which is
  free to use. The available equipment consists of:

  -   1x Nikon D750 Digital SLR Camera (24.3 MP) 3.2 inch
      Tilt-Screen LCD with Wi-Fi
  -   1x SIGMA 8mm f/3.5 EX DG Circular Fisheye Lens (Nikon fit)
  -   1x Nikon 24-120mm f4 G AF-S ED VR Lens
  -   1x KamKorda Professional Camera Bag
  -   1x Neewer Hot Shoe Three Axis Bubble Spirit Level
  -   1x SanDisk UHS-II 3.0, SD Card Reader (In the post)
  -   2x Sandisk Ultra microSDHC 16GB - 80MB/s Class 10 UHS-I
  -   1x PeliCase 1520 Case With Foam - Orange

  I’ve used this camera to estimate canopy cover of savannas in
  southern Africa and I can only imagine that it would work fine for
  your patch of woodland as well.

  When you say “map” do you mean get a spatially explicit estimate
  of the canopy cover throughout the site? I’ve only ever used
  hemispherical photography to get a single plot level estimate of
  the canopy cover. Basically the mean and variance of the
  percentage canopy cover as estimated from many photographs taken
  at points on a regular grid laid out in the woodland area. Each
  photo is essentially a point estimate of the canopy cover. You
  could probably do a map, but you would have to increase the
  density of the grid quite a bit to truly capture the variation
  over space. To give you a rough idea, on a 100x100 m (1 Ha) plot,
  I normally take 100 photos to get a plot level estimate. Taking
  the photos doesn’t take very long at all, but setting up the grid
  can be a faff if the woodland is thick.

  Processing the hemispherical images can be a pain but is fairly
  automated once you have a workflow set up. In the past I’ve used
  imageJ ([https://imagej.net/Welcome]), and if you only want to
  estimate percentage canopy cover then I see no problem with using
  it. I have some imageJ macros to batch analyse images if you want.
  If you want to estimate more advanced things like Leaf Area Index
  (the unit leaf area per unit ground area) or available
  Photosynthetically Active Radiation below the canopy, you will
  need to use something more advanced. I’ve recently discovered a
  set of R scripts collectively known as HemiPhot
  ([https://github.com/naturalis/Hemiphot]) which can estimate these
  parameters.

  The main thing to remember when taking hemispherical photos of the
  canopy is that you have to do them early in the morning or late in
  the evening, before the sun is overhead and too bright but with
  some ambient light, otherwise you will find that you get a sun
  flare on the lens, which makes the image basically unusable for
  analysis.

  I’ve attached a few papers which you can read if you want to on
  the subject of how hemispherical photography (and other methods)
  is used in forest/woodland/plantation contexts to estimate tree
  canopy structure. By no means should you read them all, but they
  might be useful further down the line.

  There are other methods for estimating canopy cover, but having
  experimented with most of them, I think hemispherical photography
  gives the most accurate result. Other options are to use a convex
  mirror densiometer
  ([http://www.forestry-suppliers.com/Images/Original/1397_43887_p1.jpg])
  or to use a periscope densitometer
  ([http://www.grsgis.com/densitometer.html]). The periscope
  densitometer might be an option for making a high point density
  map of your site, as the measurements are quite quick so you can
  do more of them. The periscope densitometer method just requires
  you to talk along the grid and at each point take a yes/no reading
  of whether there is canopy touching the crosshairs of the
  periscope mirror. You wouldn’t be able to make a map of percentage
  canopy cover with the periscope densitometer, only a plot level
  estimate as it uses the binomial nature of the measurement (yes or
  no) to statistically estimate percentage cover, the value of each
  point on its own isn’t useful. I wouldn’t EVER recommend the
  convex mirror densiometer as they suffer from pretty serious
  researcher bias.

  Measuring the shade on the land either side of the woodland would
  require a different method I think, though I’ve never done it
  myself. I get the impression that in a closed canopy woodland at
  this high a latitude, you could assume that when the path from the
  Sun to the open ground adjacent to the woodland is blocked by the
  woodland, all the direct sunlight is blocked. Considering this,
  you could just measure the maximum tree height at increments along
  the edge of the woodland using a clinometer or a laser range
  finder, measure the orientation of the woodland edge, then use
  that to model how long the shadow is at different times of the
  year and how many hours during the day a given distance from the
  woodland is shaded as the angle of the Sun changes. This has some
  assumptions/caveats though, 1) the woodland is thick enough to
  block all direct sunlight, and 2) the boundary of the woodland
  edge is a straight line. If the woodland edge isn’t a straight
  line it gets marginally more difficult as you would have to
  include more measurements of the distance of the woodland edge
  into your calculations of shade at different points.
