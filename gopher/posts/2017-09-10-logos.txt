TITLE: Making Logos for Coding Club

Over the Summer while the students are away, instead of making more
tutorials, Iâ€™ve been going back through the content on
ourcodingclub.github.io, trying to make it look more professional,
easy to read, and to fix any factual errors. One thing on my list
was to create some more logos for our tutorials page. While doing
this I made a template file so that future logos can be created
easily and all to the same standard.

  [ourcodingclub.github.io]: ourcodingclub.github.io
  [tutorials page]: ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials

I started by opening Inkscape, which is an open source vector
drawing program available on macOS, Linux and Windows.

  [Inkscape]: https://inkscape.org/

All our logos are loosely inspired by some stickers that RStudio
published so I started by tracing the hexagon shape using the
polygon tool to get the size right, adjusted the canvas size, etc..
Then after some brainstorming I added some text and images to the
logo, related to the content of that tutorial.

  [RStudio published]: https://www.stickermule.com/user/1070448958/stickers

An Rstudio sticker:

[RStudio Hexagon sticker - readr]


The new logos look like this:
