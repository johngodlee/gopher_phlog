In preparation for fieldwork I wanted to replicate my R environment
as best I could on a laptop I had borrowed from the University. Part
of this involved installing packages.

To get a list of packages on my own laptop I ran:

    packs <- installed.packages()

    packs_names <- packs[,1]

Then I saved that as a .csv and emailed myself the file on the new
computer:

    write.csv(packs_names, "names.csv")

On the new computer, I opened R, then opened the csv and installed
the packages.

    packs <- read.csv("names.csv")

    install.packages(packs[,1])
