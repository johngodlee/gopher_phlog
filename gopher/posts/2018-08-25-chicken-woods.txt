TITLE: Foraging Chicken of the Woods

====================================================================


I finally found a chicken of the woods mushroom (Laetiporus
sulphureus) and had the time and facilities to harvest some and cook
it. I’ve seen lots of chicken of the woods in the past, but have
always been too busy or have been travelling, so haven’t been able
to cook it.

I tried a little bit of it first, fried in butter, to see if it made
me feel sick as I’ve heard that it makes some people nauseous. I
think I’ll fry the rest of it to be made into breakfast sandwiches,
with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise. It really does taste like
chicken, very lemony sweet chicken, very tasty.
