I have been looking for a long long time for a better alternative to
the bulky leather or canvas wallets that are mostly available for
men. I’ve found lots of examples online, the most notable one being
the N-Wallet by Elephant Wallet, but I couldn’t bring myself to buy
one, because it’s frivolous.

Finally I spent enough time at my Mum and Dad’s house to have access
to lots of scrap materials and a pretty good workshop, so I set
about trying to make my own version.

The template I drew can be downloaded here as a .dxf, a .layout, a
.skp, and printed as an A4 .pdf, which should preserve the size so
long as there are no borders on the print. Each piece should be 90
mm (W) x 58 mm (H).

I used a piece of corrugated steel that had previously been used for
a barn roof. I used a hacksaw to cut the pieces to approximate size,
usign the template as a guide, then used a bench grinder to shape
the fine detail. To smooth everything off I used a file and then
finally sandpaper.

For the elastic band I used a piece of trouser elastic from the
sewing box, which I superglued together. But eventually I might
switch this to a thicker piece, or I might even buy one of the
stylised bands from Elephant Wallet, as they only cost a couple of
dollars and look pretty nice.
