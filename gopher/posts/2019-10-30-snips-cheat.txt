====================================================================


I made a cheatsheet for UltiSnips to try and cement some of things
I’ve learned about it over the last few days, because I want to use
it more, particularly for writing LaTeX. The cheatsheet can be found
here.

I used a pretty good LaTeX template to make the cheatsheet layout.
After I made the cheatsheet I actually found this cheatsheet
template which looks to be more flexible, so maybe I’ll try that
next time.
