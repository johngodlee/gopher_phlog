# Foraging Chicken of the Woods

I finally found a chicken of the woods mushroom (Laetiporus sulphureus) and had the time and facilities to harvest some and cook it. I've seen lots of chicken of the woods in the past, but have always been too busy or have been travelling, so haven't been able to cook it.

I tried a little bit of it first, fried in butter, to see if it made me feel sick as I've heard that it makes some people nauseous. I think I'll fry the rest of it to be made into breakfast sandwiches, with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise. It really does taste like chicken, very lemony sweet chicken, very tasty.
