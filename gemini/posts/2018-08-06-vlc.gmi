I download podcasts using pypodd[1], then I want to play the files, but I don't want to leave the terminal. I found out that VLC[2] has a some command line options, including ad really nice ncurses interface. I made an alias in my .bash_profile which starts VLC in the right way and plays a nominated file:

=> https://github.com/johngodlee/pypodd 1: https://github.com/johngodlee/pypodd
=> https://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 2: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

```
alias vlc="/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I ncurses"
```

Then in bash I can type:

```
vlc file.mp3
```

to open VLC and play the file.

There are lots of other arguments to use VLC in the command line, most of which are documented here[3].
