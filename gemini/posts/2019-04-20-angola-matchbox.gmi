# Angolan matchbox designs

I got quite into finding different designs on matchboxes while in Angola for fieldwork. Maybe it was the boredom of being in Lubango for too long. Some of the designs are quite pretty, often reminding me of old movie posters. Many of them also have flowers on them, it's just a shame that the names of the flowers aren't also on the matchboxes. Here is a selection of some of designs.
