# Spoon carving trees in the SEOSAW network

AUTHOR: John L. Godlee


For a project I've been helping out with, I had to find information on the human uses of tree species in African savannas. I used the book "Field Guide to Trees of Southern Africa[1]" by Wyk and Wyk (2013), which has lots of information in the text descriptions of each species. Of the 645 species in our plots, 346 had information on human uses in the book. While we were looking specifically at edible fruits and timber uses, there was information on a load of other things, such as religious and magical uses, medicinal uses etc. Included in this was information about which species were useful for making household utensils and spoons. I like to carve spoons so I thought I'd have a go at mapping out the locations of trees in the SEOSAW network that can be used for making spoons, this is the R code:
