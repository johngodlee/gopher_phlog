# RSS feeds for scientific journals

I use RSS to keep up with most of the media I consume, using newsboat[1] as an RSS reader. I use it for news, blogs, podcasts, youtube. I also get email alerts from a few scientific journals on their new articles, to try and keep up with current research.

Only recently did I realise	that I could use RSS to keep up with scientific journals as well. Most peer-reviewed journals have RSS feeds which list their newest articles.

I did a quick check of my master BibTeX file to see which journals I cite the most in my writing:

``` shell-script
grep "journal = " lib.bib | sed 's/.*{\(.*\)}.*/\1/g' | sort | uniq -c | sort
```

The top 10 journals by number of articles were, with their RSS feeds:

* 24 - Ecology Letters[2]
* 14 - Journal of Ecology[3]
* 14 - Global Change Biology[4]
* 14 - Forest Ecology and Management[5]
* 13 - Science[6]
* 11 - Nature[7]
* 11 - Ecology[8]
* 9  - Journal of Biogeography[9]
* 9  - Global Ecology and Biogeography[10]
* 9  - Agricultural and Forest Meteorology[11]
