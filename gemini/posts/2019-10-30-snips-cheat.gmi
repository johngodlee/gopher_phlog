# UltiSnips cheatsheet

I made a cheatsheet for UltiSnips[1] to try and cement some of things I've learned about it over the last few days, because I want to use it more, particularly for writing LaTeX. The cheatsheet can be [found here](https://johngodlee.github.io/files/snips-cheat/ultisnips_cheatsheet.pdf).

I used a pretty good LaTeX template[2] to make the cheatsheet layout. After I made the cheatsheet I actually found this cheatsheet template[3] which looks to be more flexible, so maybe I'll try that next time.
