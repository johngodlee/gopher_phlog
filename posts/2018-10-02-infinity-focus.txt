Hemispherical photography - should the focus be set to infinity? - [2018-10-02]
=================================================================================

My assumption has always been that when taking hemispherical photos of
forest canopies, the focus of the lens should always be set to infinity.
However, I’m not sure where I got this assumption from, or whether it’s
even true, I’ve just always believed it. So to set my mind at ease and
back up my reasons for telling others to set the focus to infinity I
trawled through a few papers. This is just a rundown of what those
papers were with quotes of what they sai regarding the issue.

This first paper only says that non-DSLR cameras should have the focus
set to infinity, either that or it’s confusingly written.

  All camera internalsoftware filters (e.g. sharpen the picture) need to
  be turned off. For non-DSLR cameras the “Fish-Eye setting” means that
  the zoom is fixed at the widest angle and FOCUS IS SET TO INFINITY.

  – Melrose et al. 2012

These next few simply say that they did set it to infinity, but don’t
say why..

  We used a Nikon MF-16 camera and a Nikkor 8-mm fish-eye lens with TriX
  ASA 400 film, a red filter to increase sharpness of leaf edges, and
  the FOCUS SET TO INFINITY.

  – Englund et al. 2000

  The lens was set to a small aperture and FOCUSED ON INFINITY (Frazer
  et al. 2001; Zhu et al. 2003)

  – Hu et al. 2009

  Exposure settings were selected to obtain the best contrast between
  foliage and sky and making the last one appear white (cloudy sky
  offers the best condition in this context). The camera was used in
  automatic mode using the parameters fixed in FISHEYE1 lens mode (FOCUS
  SET TO INFINITY, widest zoom, metering center-weighted), and the
  shutter speed was varied automatically by the camera.

  – Paletto & Tosi 2009

This next quote comes from a paper which many others reference when
describing proper protocol for taking hemispherical photos:

  Unlike the Nikon F, the digital camera did not allow full manual
  control of both the shutter speed and lens aperture. We therefore SET
  THE AUTOFOCUS, EXPOSURE MODE, AND F-STOP OF THE DIGITAL CAMERA TO
  INFINITY, aperture priority (shutter speed is set automatically by the
  camera), and f/2.6, respectively.

  – Frazer et al. 2001

This one references a really dodgy looking old downloadable tutorial
series on taking good digital photos, called 123di. Most of it is behind
a paywall though, so I can’t read the applicable bit. But at least it
sort of says why they set the focus to infinity, because the depth of
field is practically infinite under these conditions.

  Photographic images were recorded using a Sigma 8 mm f/4 ‘fisheye’
  lens (Sigma Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at the highest possible
  resolution (3040 × 2008 pixels) with highest ISO setting (ISO 200).
  Moreover, THE FOCUS RING WAS SET TO INFINITY WHEN USING THE FISHEYE
  LENS, AS DEPTH OF FIELD IS PRACTICALLY INFINITE AND FOCUSING WAS NOT
  REQUIRED (BOCKAERT, 2004).
