TITLE: Scripting qutebrowser to grab papers with scidownl

====================================================================


I have been using [scidownl] to download scientific papers using
that I find on the web. It’s quicker than using the journals’ own
pdf download interface, which often requires multiple button clicks
and validating through my university.

  [scidownl]: https://github.com/Tishacy/SciDownl

With scidownl I can copy a DOI that I find on the web and download
the paper:

    scidownl -D "10.2307/3236848"

To further streamline the process, I wrote a little keybinding for
[qutebrowser], my web browser, which allows me to highlight a DOI
on the webpage, hit the keybinding (,d), and download the paper to
my ~/Downloads directory in the background for reading later:

  [qutebrowser]: https://qutebrowser.org/

    config.bind(',d', 'enter-mode caret ;; yank selection ;; spawn ~/bin/scidownl_qb {clipboard}')

scidownl_qb is just a shell script which downloads the file to the
right location:

    #!/usr/bin/env sh

    /usr/local/bin/./scidownl -D "$1" -o /Users/johngodlee/Downloads

Note that I had to include the full path to the scidownl executable
in the shell script. This is because [qutebrowser uses a different
$PATH to the rest of the OS].
