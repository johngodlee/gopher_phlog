TITLE: Constructing diversity profiles with Hill numbers

====================================================================


Hill numbers represent a shared form of diversity indices. The order
(q) of a Hill number determines its sensitivity to rare vs. abundant
species, by modifying how the weighted mean of the species
proportional abundances is calculated. Common diversity indices are
special cases of Hill numbers:

  q   Diversity index
  --- ---------------------------
  0   Species richness
  1   Exponential Shannon index
  2   Inverse Simpsons index

Hill numbers show the “effective number of species”. That is, the
number of equally abundant species needed to produce the observed
value of diversity. Compared to traditional diversity indices, the
relationship between Hill numbers and diversity is geometric. If you
double the number of species present with the same abundance, the
value of the Hill number will also double.

To investigate the contributions of rare and abundant species in a
community it is sometimes desirable to plot a diversity profile,
showing the value of diversity calculated along a continuum of the
order q. I wrote some R functions to do this easily.

    # Load data
    library(vegan)
    data(BCI)
    ##' A species (columns) by site (rows) matrix of abundance values

    # Calculate diversity for any order q
    qd <- function(data, q = 1){ 
        # Convert to matrix
        data <- drop(as.matrix(data))

        # get relative abundance
        data <- sweep(data, 1, apply(data, 1, sum), "/")

        # Calculate hill numbers
        if (q == 0) { # Richness
            hill <- apply(data > 0, 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
        } elseif (q==1) { # Shannon 
            data <- -data * log(data)
            hill <- exp(apply(data, 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE)) 
        } else { # Other Hill number
            data <- data^q # p_i^q
            hill <- (apply(data, 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE))^(1/(1 - q))
        } 
        return(hill)
    }

    # Calculate hill numbers over range of q
    qd_curve <- function(data, qmin = 0, qmax = 5) {
        # Define range of q
        qrange <- seq(from = qmin , to = qmax , by = 0.01)

        # For each value of q, calculate hill numbers for each site
        qdf <- sapply(qrange , function(x){ 
            qd(data, x)
        })

        # Transpose to clean dataframe
        qclean <- data.frame(cbind(qrange , t(qdf)))
        names(qclean)[1] <- "qrange"
        
        return(qclean)
    }

qd_curve() returns a dataframe of sites (columns) by Hill number
order q (rows). This dataframe can then be used to plot a diversity
profile with a line for each site.

    library(vegan) 
    library(ggplot2) 
    library(dplyr) 
    library(tidyr)

    data(BCI)

    qd_curve(BCI) %>%
        gather("id", "value", -qrange) %>% 
        ggplot(., aes(x = qrange, y = value)) +
            geom_line(aes(group = id))
