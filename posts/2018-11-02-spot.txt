TITLE: My spot in the woods in Autumn

At the weekend I went to my favourite spot just outside Edinburgh to
check up on what has been happening. I cycled out of Edinburgh on my
black road bike, taking a backpack with some essential bike repair
stuff like a multitool, patches, tyre levers and a pump. I also took
a few small bits used for wood-working, an axe, big fixed blade
knife, spoon knife, and a folding saw.

The autumn leaves were at their peak, with beautiful golden coppery
colours.

When I got to my spot, which I don’t think many people know about, I
found that I had a lot of work to do. The oak tree that I normally
sit under had lost a limb, presumably it had split off in the high
wind we had in September. I found that the fallen limb had covered a
lot of the space so I decided to process some of the wood and hide
it in a spot under an overhanging tree root to keep it dry until I
came back.

There was also a large straight silver birch that had been uprooted
in the high winds and had slid down the hill a bit. I intend to go
back and collect some of that later with a big saw later in the
year.

The sedges that mat the woodland floor around there are really nice
to sit on to do some woodcarving
