TITLE: My vimdiff setup

====================================================================


Here is the relevant part of my .vimrc which deals with vimdiff.
Annoyingly, but maybe necessarilly, vimdiff uses a lot of different
options to normal vim.

    " Disable folding
    set diffopt+=context:99999

    " Disable diffing on whitespace
    set diffopt+=iwhite

    " Softwrap lines
    au VimEnter * if &diff | execute 'windo set wrap' | endif

    " Disable syntax highlighting
    if &diff
        syntax off
    endif

    " Change highlight colours so they are less garish
    hi DiffAdd      cterm=none ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=Red
    hi DiffChange   cterm=none ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=Gray
    hi DiffDelete   cterm=none ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=Red
    hi DiffText     cterm=none ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=DarkGray

Ordinarily, if large chunks of the two diffed files are identical,
they are folded away to avoid distraction. I don’t actually like
that, I get confused about where in the document I am, so I disable
it with set diffopt+=context:99999.

Diffing on whitespace is almost always a bad idea, so that’s
disabled by default.

By default, lines in vimdiff run off the edge of the page, which
makes it difficult to see differences between files. That’s dumb, so
softwrap is used instead.

When syntax highlighting is used there are too many conflicting
colours on the page, making it hard to follow what needs to be
changed, so syntax highlighting is disabled.

Finally, to further help with the super bright colours, I redefine
the colours used show differences between files, so only the
background colours are changed. This way the colours are never too
loud even with different colour schemes.
