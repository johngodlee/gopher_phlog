Making a Gopherhole - [2019-11-20]
====================================

I have heard people on youtube, mostly [DistroTube] and [Hex
DSL], talking about [Gopher]. I also saw it being discussed on
[Hacker News] once.

The youtubers and digitial minimalist / linux try-hards have recently
begun lauding Gopher as a sane alternative to browsing the internet
with HTTP and the World Wide Web, which they say are bloated and
beyond redemption since advertisers and data harvesters have taken
over.

Gopher is an internet protocol that was created in 1991. In my mind
it sits alongside FTP more than it does HTTP, in that it is merely a
way of organising file delivery in a heirarchical fashion. It doesn’t
have the flexibility of HTTP, providing only plain text formatted by
certain conventions and a smattering of links to connect files and
pages. Some think this inflexibility is a good thing, Gopher sites
are: simple, transparent, text based (good for the visually impaired)
and consistent. In Gopher it’s hard to implement most of the more
destructive mechanisms present on the World Wide Web like user
tracking, data harvesting and advertising. Gopher sites are also
phenomenally light on resources, providing just plain text. It’s not
that HTTP can’t be fast as well, but there is a tendency to use all
the features that the flexibility of HTTP can afford. That being
said, I think a lot of people are confusing the World Wide Web with
the internet. Gopher is an internet protocol, but it satisfies a
different set of needs to HTTP and they shouldn’t be compared so
readily.

I set up a Gopher site (aka a Gopherhole) on the [Super Dimension
Fortress], which provides its registered and validated users with
gopherspace for free. It also provides lots of other services run
through a shell account that you can SSH into, such as POP3/IMAP
mail, and IRC. They are a good community of hobbyists which provides
a valuable if computationally limiting service. There are lots of
other places to host a Gopherhole and it’s also possible to
self-host, and there are a few Gopher server softwares out there, the
most popular right now being [pygopherd], I think.

First I created a shell account, logged in, and validated my
membership with a $3 USD donation to the SDF by PayPal. My validation
came through in about 12 hours, but I imagine this varies a bit. I
SSH’d into my shell account with:

    ssh username@tty.sdf.org

After entering my password I could then create a gopher with
mkgopher, which creates a directory ~/gopher. Inside this directory
is where I store all my gopher content. mkgopher also allows various
site level options to be configured, such as the site title and the
site description. It’s also important to set file and directory
permissions so that other users can read the material in the
gopherhole. This can be done automatically within mkgopher with the
chmod command, or manually:

    find ~/gopher/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 644
    find ~/gopher/ -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 755



GOPHERMAPS


At the root of ~/gopher there should be a file called gophermap. This
file defines the homepage of your gopherhole, with plain text and
links to reach other content.

An example gophermap looks like this:

    iWelcome to gopherspace /

    0This is a text file in a link  file.txt
    9This is a pdf file in a link   file.pdf
    1This is a link to a directory  subdir

    iSome more text.    /

    IAn image   img.gif

    0A file on another server   /gopher/relevance.txt   gopher.floodgap.com 70
    hA HTTP link to another server  URL:http://sdf.lonestar.org/

The numbers, and some letters are called itemtypes. They denote what
type of information the line holds. There are a bunch of itemtypes,
but I think the commonly used itemtypes nowadays are:

  Itemtype             Content
  ---------- -----------------
  0                  Text file
  1                  Directory
  7               Search query
  9                Binary file
  g                  GIF image
  h                   HTML URL
  i                inline text
  s                 Sound file
  I            Image (not-GIF)

The full syntax of the whole line is, for a text file for example:

    0Description of file<TAB>/path/to/content.md<TAB>domain.org<TAB>port_number

Note that <TAB> must be an ACTUAL tab character, not expanded to
multiple spaces as some text editors ‘helpfully’ adjust it. The 0
defines the line as pointing to a text file. Description of file will
appear in the page as a selectable link. /path/to/content defines the
path to the text file to be opened by the link. File paths can be
defined relative to the current gophermap, so if file.txt is located
in the same directory as gophermap the path can just be file.txt. If
the file is located on the same server as gophermap, domain.org and
port_number can be omitted. If the file is on a different server, the
server domain (domain.org) should be added and the port number, which
is usually 70. So if the address of the remote file linked is
gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/0/gopher/relevance.txt, the domain name
is gopher.floodgap.com.

As a side note, I’ve found that in gopher browsers, if you want to
visit the rendered version of a gophermap, you can enter the address
like this, with a 1 after the domain:

    gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/gopher

If you want to view the unrendered version of the gophermap, you can
replace the 1 with a 0.

For a piece of text, the gophermap syntax is similar, but not exactly
the same:

    iSome text that will appear on its own<TAB>/

A single slash should be included after a single <TAB> following the
text to be displayed. An i should be included before the text.

I’ve found that the 9 itemtype can cover many non-standard filetypes,
as it basically just prompts the web browser to download the file.

Directories can be nested below the top level gopherspace directory.
Each of these directories can have their own gophermap, but they
don’t have to. In the top level gophermap the directory can be called
as:

    1This is a link to a directory<TAB>subdir

If there is a gophermap in subdir/ it will be opened. This
subdir/gophermap can contain relative links to files the same as the
top level gophermap.

There isn’t a lot more to creating a simple functional gophermap, the
rest is just text formatting to design a well formatted page. I like
to split the top level gophermap into sections with headers wrapped
in == symbols, and to have an ASCII art header at the very top of the
top level gophermap. It’s also customary to limit the width of a
gopher page to 69 characters, but I haven’t found any technical
reason why this would be the case:

    i      _       _            _         _____           _ _               /
    i     | |     | |          | |       / ____|         | | |              /
    i     | | ___ | |__  _ __  | |      | |  __  ___   __| | | ___  ___     /
    i _   | |/ _ \| '_ \| '_ \ | |      | | |_ |/ _ \ / _` | |/ _ \/ _ \    /
    i| |__| | (_) | | | | | | || |___ _ | |__| | (_) | (_| | |  __/  __/    /
    i \____/ \___/|_| |_|_| |_||_____(_) \_____|\___/ \__,_|_|\___|\___|    /

BROWSERS


To browse Gopher pages the [Lynx] browser in the terminal is the
most common way I think. Otherwise there are plugins for some web
browsers, like the [Overbite plugin for Firefox]. There are also a
few different online Gopher to HTML proxy services where you type in
the gopher address and the output is rendered in HTML,
e.g. [GopherProxy], [Floodgap’s proxy], or [Gopher Commons].

  [Lynx]: https://lynx.invisible-island.net/
  [Overbite plugin for Firefox]: https://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/
  [GopherProxy]: https://gopherproxy.meulie.net/
  [Floodgap’s proxy]: https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw
  [Gopher Commons]: https://gopher.commons.host/

I like to use the [w3m browser] which I couldn’t get to load gopher
pages by default, but I did find an [awk script on Bitbucket] which
converts Gopher to HTML and then serves it through w3m. So far it is
working pretty well, but I still found myself loading up Lynx when I
was building my page initially to make sure everything was formatted
correctly.

CONVERTING A GITHUB-PAGES BLOG TO JEKYLL


I created a shell script which generates a gopherhole with a
directory tree like this:

    .
    ├── contact.txt
    ├── cv.txt
    ├── gophermap
    ├── posts
    │   ├── 2017-07-20-ranger-rifle-conf-mac.txt
    │   ├── 2017-08-14-bash-prompt.txt
    │   ├── 2019-11-10-beamer.txt
    │   ├── 2019-11-15-gginext.txt
    │   └── gophermap
    └── recipes
        ├── Apricot_orange_blossom_baklava.txt
        ├── Baked_pumpkin_with_apple.txt
        └── gophermap 

It’s basically just a load of shell scripts. First I use pandoc to
convert the recipes and blog posts to plain text with something like:

    pandoc --from markdown --to plain --reference-links --reference-location=block -o posts/post_1.txt post_1.md

Then I put the title of each blog post as a link into the gophermap
using sed in a for loop, with something like this:

    all=(posts/*.txt)

    # Reverse order of posts array
    for (( i=${#all[@]}-1; i>=0; i-- )); do 
        rev_all[${#rev_all[@]}]=${all[i]}
    done

    # Get 10 most recent posts
    recent="${rev_all[@]:0:10}"

    # Add recent post links to gophermap
    for i in $recent; do
        line=$(head -n 1 $i)
        printf "0$line\t$i\n" >> gophermap
    done

Those were just simplified examples, it’s easy to add header material
from another file or format the link text differently.
