Rebuilding a bike - [2018-07-25]
==================================

The bike that I normally use around town is in storage for the
summer, and I was missing having a bike. I’ve also been wanting to
refurbish an old bike for a long time, to learn skills and understand
the mechanics and compatibility issues with building bikes. I found
this BSA Tour De France on Gumtree for £30 and it immediately got my
attention:

I decided to make the bike into a single speed, as I’ve already got a
decent geared bike, so I set about stripping it down, removing the
rear derailleur and the down-tube friction shifter.

Lots of people suggest using a [single speed conversion kit] to
change the gear setup, but these rely on the rear wheel having a
cassette on the backwheel, rather than a freehub. [Sheldon Brown]
has a good guide on identifying whether you have a freewheel or a
cassette. Basically, cassettes come apart and you can slide off and
rearrange the cogs or replace them with spacers, while freewheels
have a group of cogs all connected together that screw onto the hub.
A lot of older bikes with their original wheels have freewheels, as
mine did, meaning that a single speed conversion kit won’t work. Some
people recommend just screwing on a [single speed freewheel], like
the sort you would put onto a BMX, but this would mess up the chain
line as the wheel on a multispeed bike will be dished to allow space
on the driveside to fit a multispeed freewheel, and a single speed
freewheel is much smaller. You can redish the wheel, but this was
beyond my expertise, so I just kept the 5 speed freewheel that was
already on the wheel. Maybe later I’ll learn about re-dishing the
wheel, as single speed freewheels aren’t that expensive. Having all
the cogs also made it super easy to pick the cog which had the best
chainline to the front cog.

To keep tension on the chain and to ensure that the chain stays on
the correct rear cog, I bought a chain tensioner. This is a bit like
a stripped down rear derailleur. THe type I bought is spring loaded
and screws into the rear mech hanger. Specifically I bought the [4
Jeri SS Chain Tensioner]. I could have removed the rear mech hanger
completely and used the horizontal dropouts on the frame to set the
frame tension, but I find using a chain tensioner much easier and
reduces maintenance.

I replaced the seatpost with longer one, making sure to check the
diameter of the bottom of the seatpost to fit into the frame AND the
top of the seatpost to make sure it fits into the seat clamp. Maybe
in retrospect it would just have been easier to buy a seatpost that
came with a clamp, but I was trying to save on materials as much as
possible.

The last thing I did was replace the bar tape, as it had become all
worn down. I watched a [tutorial from Park Tool] on how to properly
wrap the tape:

UPDATE - 2018_09_09


I finally got this bike out of storage after the summer break. I
counted the gear ratio, it’s got 46 on the front and 16 on the rear,
which is nearly a 3:1 ratio, which is actually quite normal for
single speed bikes, though possibly more suited to a fixed gear than
a freewheel like mine.
