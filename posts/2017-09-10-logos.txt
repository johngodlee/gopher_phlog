Making Logos for Coding Club - [2017-09-10]
=============================================

Over the Summer while the students are away, instead of making more
tutorials, I’ve been going back through the content on
[ourcodingclub.github.io], trying to make it look more
professional, easy to read, and to fix any factual errors. One thing
on my list was to create some more logos for our [tutorials page].
While doing this I made a template file so that future logos can be
created easily and all to the same standard.

  [ourcodingclub.github.io]: ourcodingclub.github.io
  [tutorials page]: ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials

I started by opening [Inkscape], which is an open source vector
drawing program available on macOS, Linux and Windows.

All our logos are loosely inspired by some stickers that [RStudio
published] so I started by tracing the hexagon shape using the
polygon tool to get the size right, adjusted the canvas size, etc..
Then after some brainstorming I added some text and images to the
logo, related to the content of that tutorial.

The new logos look like this:
