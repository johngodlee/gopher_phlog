Spoon carving trees in the SEOSAW network - [2018-08-20]
==========================================================

For a project I’ve been helping out with, I had to find information
on the human uses of tree species in African savannas. I used the
book “[Field Guide to Trees of Southern Africa]” by Wyk and Wyk
(2013), which has lots of information in the text descriptions of
each species. Of the 645 species in our plots, 346 had information on
human uses in the book. While we were looking specifically at edible
fruits and timber uses, there was information on a load of other
things, such as religious and magical uses, medicinal uses etc.
Included in this was information about which species were useful for
making household utensils and spoons. I like to carve spoons so I
thought I’d have a go at mapping out the locations of trees in the
SEOSAW network that can be used for making spoons, this is the R
code:
