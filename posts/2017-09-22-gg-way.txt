Walking the Great Glen Way - [2017-09-22]
===========================================

This Summer I walked the Great Glen Way, an 80 mile trail which runs
from Inverness to Fort William, along the side of Loch Ness, Loch Lochy
and Loch Oich.

The trail took me 3.5 days of walking and is one of the easiest trail
hikes I’ve done, it was also one of the most beautiful.

Campsite

For my campsite I had a small triangular tarp that I had from some
offcuts from another bigger project. The tarp is held down by tent pegs
on three corners and raised in the middle by my walking pole, there is a
small guyrope made from paracord that keeps the walking pole upright. I
can fit about half my body underneath the tarp with my bag and boots to
keep the rain and morning dew off. Then the bivvy bag covers the lower
half of my body.

For such a light piece of material the tarp makes bivvy camping
immeasurably more comfortable, mainly because I can sleep with my head
outside the bivvy bag, even when it is raining, reducing the amount of
condensation drastically.
