TITLE: Shell script for internet radio

I’ve been feeling nostalgic for a holiday I took last year to New
Mexico in the USA. We spent a lot of time listening to country radio
stations and driving through the beautiful scenery. While I am
confined to home I thought it would be nice to listen to those radio
stations again, but I was finding it laborious to listen to the
radio through my web browser.

Most internet radio streams have a URL, which can be scraped usually
by looking at the HTML of the webpage, or rarely if the radio
provider is feeling public spirited, in plain text on the streaming
page. These URLs are mostly readable by [VLC] if they are .mp3,
.ogg, m3u, .pls and probably many more. The backend of VLC’s
streaming capabilities is an in-built plugin called Icecast,
previously Shoutcast. I made a simple text file of these URLs along
with the names of the stations:

  [VLC]: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.en-GB.html

    https://radiostationusa.fm/apii.php?url=https://stream.revma.ihrhls.com/zc1385,Big I 107.9 Albuquerque New Country 
    http://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_radio1_mf_p,BBC Radio 1
    http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/nonuk/sbr_vlow/llnw/bbc_radio_fourlw.m3u8,BBC Radio 4 LW

Then I wrote a shell script which uses [fzf] to neatly display the
radio station names, then uses sed and grep to send the URL to the
ncurses version of VLC, which on macOS at least is stored in
/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I ncurses when VLC is
installed using Homebrew.

  [fzf]: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

    #!/bin/sh

    stations="$HOME/.radio.txt"

    sel=$(sed 's/^.*,//' ${stations} | fzf)

    url=$(grep "${sel}" ${stations} | sed 's/,.*$//')

    vlc "${url}"
