Shell script to get wifi password in macOS - [2019-11-05]
===========================================================

macOS uses the BSD security command to access information from the
system keychain. With this command you can access all the same
information which is normally stored in Keychain Access.app and more. I
wrote a script which prints the WiFi password for either the current
network, or a specified network to the terminal. This was mostly an
exercise for me to learn how getopts works.

The script is below:

    #!/bin/bash

    ssid=$(/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep " SSID:" | awk -F': ' '{print $2}')

    while getopts ":n:" opt; do
        case $opt in 
            n)
                # If flag is given with argument
                ssid="$OPTARG"
                ;;
            \?)
                # If incorrect flag given
                echo "-$OPTARG is not a valid option" >&2
                exit 1
                ;;
            :)
                # If flag is given without argument
                echo "-$OPTARG requires an argument" >&2
                exit 1
                ;;
        esac
    done

    security find-generic-password -wga "$ssid"

If I run ./wifi.sh -n SSID the script will look for a network with the
SSID SSID then return its password. If I run ./wifi.sh -n I will get the
response: -n requires an argument. If I run ./wifi.sh -a I will get the
response: -a is not a valid option. If I run ./wifi.sh I will get the
password for the WiFi network I am currently attached to.
