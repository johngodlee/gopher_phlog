Notes on Poisson regression - [2019-09-21]
============================================

I was teaching on a field course where lots of the students ended up
with count data that they needed to analyse, so I thought I should
brush up on my knowledge of generalised linear models for count data.
The notes can be found [here].

I’m really getting into making notes in LaTeX, with practice I’m
getting faster and faster and my workflow is improving as well. I’ve
ditched TeXShop for the most part and now just use vim with VimTeX
along with UltiSnips to make it easier to insert boilerplate code for
figures, tables etc.
