TITLE: My workflow, tmux, vim, etc.

I thought I should do the sort of post that everyone seems to do and
show off my workflow, with all the horrendously try-hard command
line utilities, and DIY config files. You can find my dotfiles
[here].

I spend most of my time working on my macbook pro, within an iTerm2
window running tmux.

I have a bash script that builds a tmux session and fills it with
useful programs. I have vim in one window, then a whole load of
small empty shell panes in the next window, and finally cmus in the
last window for playing music:

    #!/bin/sh

    # Create new session
    tmux -2 new -s 'dash'

    # Start vim
    tmux send-keys "vim" Enter

    # New window, split into 4
    tmux new-window -n 'bash'
    tmux split-window -v
    tmux split-window -h
    tmux select-pane -t 1
    tmux split-window -h

    # Split pane 1 vertically
    tmux select-pane -t 1
    tmux split-window -v

    # Split pane 5 horizontally
    tmux select-pane -t 5
    tmux split-window -h

    # Resize panes
    tmux resize-pane -D 8

    # New window, start cmus
    tmux new-window -n 'cmus'
    tmux send-keys "cmus" Enter

    # Detach and reattach to make it work properly
    tmux detach
    tmux a -t dash
    tmux select-window -t 1

I dabbled in using tmux-resurrect and tmux-continuum to save my tmux
sessions when I rebooted, but I found that these plugins weren’t
always reliable. Besides, I don’t usually reboot my laptop unless
I’ve first saved all my files.

I used to have a lot more things running in tmux. I used alpine to
manage email from my gmail account, and I used the calendar.vim
plugin with a custom .vimrc to link to my google calendar, but when
I started back working full time I found that it actually saved me a
bit of time to just use the default macOS Calendar and Mail apps.

Note-taking

I use vim to take all my notes. I use markdown to format all my
notes. I have a note for each day, or at least each workday. The
basic format of my daily note is:

    # Item 1
    * Thing to do one
    * Thing to do two
        * detail 1
        * detail 2

    <hr>    

    # Item 2
    * Thing to do one

    ==================DONE===================
    * Thing to do, done

    ==================DONE===================

At the end of the day, I copy that day’s note into a new note with
tomorrow’s date. So in the end I have a folder of notes with names
like this:

    Daily_2017_10_26.md
    Daily_2017_10_27.md
    Daily_2017_10_28.md

I also have this neat way of roughly tracking how productive I’ve
been. I can count the number of lines within the
==================DONE=================== tags. Then I can turn that
into a csv, then import that into R and plot a graph of how much
I’ve done over time. It’s not that useful, but was a fun project to
put together, and a way to learn about grep.

The bash script:

    #!/bin/bash

    # Create csv file of completed items from daily notes by counting lines between #DONE# marks
    touch ~/Desktop/word_count.txt

    # Using a for loop and multiple sed arguments to amend the file (takes longer)
    for f in ./*; do { printf '%s ' "$f"; sed -n '/DONE/,/DONE/p' "$f" | wc -l; } >> ~/Desktop/word_count.txt; done

    # Make multiple whitespace into 1 whitespace, to csv
    awk '{$1=$1}1' ~/Desktop/word_count.txt > ~/Desktop/word_count.csv

    # Replace "md " with "md,"
    perl -pi -w -e  's/md\s/md,/g;' ~/Desktop/word_count.csv

    # Add column names
    echo -e "date,count\n$(cat ~/Desktop/word_count.csv)" > ~/Desktop/word_count.csv

    # delete txt file
    rm ~/Desktop/word_count.txt

    # Run R script
    Rscript ~/Google_Drive/Code/R/done_count.R

The R script:

    # Personal productivity by #DONE# items in Daily notes

    # Packages ----
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)

    # Load data ----
    prod <- read.csv("~/Desktop/word_count.csv")

    # Clean up ----
    prod$date <- prod$date %>%
        gsub("./Daily_", "", .) %>%  # Remove leading filename section
        gsub(".md", "", .) %>%  # Remove trailing filename section
        as.Date(., format = "%Y_%m_%d")  # Transform to Date class

    # ggplot line graph ----
    done_count <- ggplot(prod, aes(x = date, y = count)) +
        geom_line() +
        scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b", date_breaks = "1 month")

    ggsave(filename = "ggplot_done_count.png",
                 plot = done_count,
                 width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm")

Edit 2017_12_08

I’ve been thinking more about the note-taking philosophy and have
noticed a few trends in my own note-taking that make it easier for
me to read things back at a later date. This has mostly come about
because I am now starting to re-read my notes on academic papers as
I start to write my confirmation report.

-   Keep notes short - It’s much easier to read notes back when they
    are only on short lines. Only one sentence per line
-   Nested bullet points - In line with trying to keep notes short,
    it follows that nested bullet points are a great way to give
    some sense of inherent structure to your note taking, and make
    it easier to memorise things like lists of species. Nested notes
    also do a good job at maintaining a logical flow to discussions,
    by allowing you to put a retort to a particular piece of
    evidence as a nested bullet under the main bullet point.
-   Use keywords and repeat yourself - I find it much easier to
    search through long sets of notes if I have keywords to search
    for. In this sense, it follows that each bullet point should be
    its own self-encapsulated bundle of information, which relies
    little on other bullet points to give it context, this makes it
    much easier to scan through bullet points for the useful
    information.
-   Use Markdown - This isn’t entirely necessary, but I’ve found it
    to be a great way of quickly applying formatting to my notes, as
    opposed to what I used to do with Microsoft Word and WYSIWYG
    formatting.

Screens and deskspace

I do nearly all of my work at my desk in the University. I have a
widescreen monitor with a trailing HDMI cable that I can plug into
my laptop, then to the right I have a HP all-in-one running Windows
that is hooked up to the University network, just in case I need to
use some piece of Windows software. For example, when I’m testing
workshops for undergraduate students.
