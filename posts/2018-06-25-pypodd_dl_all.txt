I’ve been working a bit more on Pypodd recently, cleaning up the code
a bit and making it slightly more user friendly.

One thing I did was to include an option at the start of the program
which allows you to choose to download the most recent episode of
each podcast. This is the snippet of the code which lets you do that,
mostly using feedparser to compile lists of RSS feeds and extract the
important bits of information:

    while input_exit != 2:  # Terminate program if input_exit == 2
        count_opt = 1
        optListAllNo = ['All most recent episodes', 'Specific episode']  # A list of options
        for i in optListAllNo:
            print(str(count_opt) + ") " + i) 
            count_opt += 1
        input_all_no = input("\nChoose an option: ")
        input_all_no = int(input_all_no)
        if input_all_no == 1:
            feedList = []  # Create empty list
            for i in urlList:  # Put the parsed feeds in the list
                parseBar = Bar("Parsing feeds", max = len(subList))
                feedList.append(feedparser.parse(i))
                parseBar.next()
            parseBar.finish()
            ep0List = []  # Create empty lists
            name0List = []
            link0List = []
            for i in feedList:  # Extract most recent episode from each feed
                ep0List.append(i['entries'][0])
            for i in ep0List:  
                link0List.append(i['enclosures'][0]['href'])  # Extract download URL from list
                name0List.append(i['title'])  # Extract episode name from list
            print("\n Downloading all most recent episodes")
            
            dlExt = ".mp3"
            for i, j in zip(link0List, name0List):  # Download most recent episode and give names
                    dlName = j.replace("/", "_")
                    dlFile = destDir + dlName + dlExt
                    dlURL = i
                    dlProg().get(dlURL, dlFile)
            print("\nFinished, exiting")  # Exit

            input_exit = 2
        elif input_all_no == 2:    
    ...  # Code continues with other options below

I’m still hoping that at some point in the future I can implement a
databse style structure which says which episodes have been
downloaded already and flags them on the list of available episodes.

I’m also having trouble in that some of the progress bars replicate
if they are too long for the line. This doesn’t affect the function
of the program at all, but it does make it look really messy.
