Visualising Survey Data with Likert Scales - [2017-09-16]
===========================================================

Recently I was offered a small amount of consulting work. A company had
conducted a survey over Survey Monkey to look at how satisfied and
engaged their employees were and my job was to analyse these data to try
and tease out any trends. Finally I had to visualise the data in a way
that the company could put together in a little report and talk about in
a meeting. Obviously I can’t show any of the graphs or data that I
analysed for that job, because of confidentiality laws, so I’ve created
an example dataset that I can use to demonstrate some of the methods I
came up with for effectively visualising the data.

I used R to analyse the data, purely because that is what I know, though
I know the company does the vast majority of their stuff in Excel.

If you want to follow along you can download the data from [here] and
an example script from [here][1]

CLEANING THE DATA


First I need to install some packages, set the working directory and
load the data into R:

    # Packages
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    library(ggplot2)

    # Set the working directory
    setwd("~/survey_data")

    # Import data
    survey <- read.csv("example.csv")

Then I can have a look at the data and see that Survey Monkey has given
each respondent a row, each column indicates an answer for a given
question, e.g. “I would work for comX again - Disagree”, “What type of
employee are you - Admin”. This means that in any given column many of
the cells are empty, and it violates one of the golden rules of making a
table of data, that each column should contain unique data.

I have no idea why survey monkey thinks this is a good way to format
their data output, but luckily it’s easy to remedy using some dplyr and
tidyr magic

First I need to check for any NA and replace them with blank space:

    survey[is.na(survey)] <- ''

Then I need to get rid of the first row which contains the names of the
answer options for each question, as it’s not useful:

    survey <- survey %>%
        slice(2:n())

Then I need to concatenate groups of columns so that each column
contains the answers for a unique question:

    # Split the data frame into a data frame for each question
    survey_employee <- survey_header %>%
        select(1:4) 

    survey_again <- survey_header %>%
        select(5:9)

    survey_always <- survey_header %>%
        select(10:14)

    survey_line <- survey_header %>%
        select(15:19)

    survey_think <- survey_header %>%
        select(20:24)

    # Concatenate columns in each data frame:
    what_type_of_employee_are_you <- unite(survey_employee, what_type_of_employee_are_you, 1:4, sep='', remove=F)[1]
    i_would_work_for_comx_again <- unite(survey_again, i_would_work_for_comx_again, 1:5, sep='', remove=F)[1]
    i_am_always_busy_at_comx <- unite(survey_always, i_am_always_busy_at_comx, 1:5, sep='', remove=F)[1]
    my_line_manager_values_my_contributions <- unite(survey_line, my_line_manager_values_my_contributions, 1:5, sep='', remove=F)[1]
    i_think_directors_are_paid_the_right_amount <- unite(survey_think, i_think_directors_are_paid_the_right_amount, 1:5, sep='', remove=F)[1]

    # Combine into data frame
    survey_cond <- data.frame(what_type_of_employee_are_you, i_would_work_for_comx_again,
                i_am_always_busy_at_comx, my_line_manager_values_my_contributions,
                i_think_directors_are_paid_the_right_amount)

Now each column has all the answers for a question, and no two columns
contain data relating to the same question.



MAKING PIVOT TABLES


I can convert the answers for each question into a numerical form,
centred on zero:

    survey_cond_num <- survey_cond %>%
        mutate(i_would_work_for_comx_again = recode(i_would_work_for_comx_again,
            "Strongly disagree" = -2,
            "Disagree" = -1,
            "Neither agree nor disagree" = 0,
            "Agree" = 1,
            "Strongly agree" = 2),
        i_am_always_busy_at_comx = recode(i_am_always_busy_at_comx,
            "Strongly disagree" = -2,
            "Disagree" = -1,
            "Neither agree nor disagree" = 0,
            "Agree" = 1,
            "Strongly agree" = 2),
        my_line_manager_values_my_contributions = recode(my_line_manager_values_my_contributions,
            "strongly disagree" = -2,
            "disagree" = -1,
            "neither agree nor disagree" = 0,
            "agree" = 1,
            "strongly agree" = 2),
        i_think_directors_are_paid_the_right_amount = recode(i_think_directors_are_paid_the_right_amount,
            "strongly disagree" = -2,
            "disagree" = -1,
            "neither agree nor disagree" = 0,
            "agree" = 1,
            "strongly agree" = 2))

Then use this new data frame to create pivot tables for each question,
showing how each employee group scored:

    heirarchy <- c("Director", "Consultant", "HR", "Admin")
    col_names <- names(select(survey_cond, 2:5))

    summ_all <- survey_cond %>%
        select(what_type_of_employee_are_you, col_names) %>%
        gather(key, value, -what_type_of_employee_are_you) %>%
        split(.$key) %>%
        lapply(function(x){x %>% group_by(what_type_of_employee_are_you, value) %>%
                tally() %>%
                spread(value, n, fill = 0) %>%
                ungroup() %>%
                mutate(what_type_of_employee_are_you = factor(what_type_of_employee_are_you, levels = heirarchy)) %>%
                arrange(what_type_of_employee_are_you) %>%
                select(what_type_of_employee_are_you,
                             `Strongly disagree`,
                             Disagree,
                             `Neither agree nor disagree`,
                             Agree,
                             `Strongly agree`)
        })

    # Write to csv
    for (i in seq_along(summ_all)) {
        write.csv(summ_all[[i]], paste("pivot_tables/",names(summ_all[i]), ".csv", sep = ""))
    }

These pivot tables can be investigated later on or used to easily create
bar charts for each question like the one below:

    # Read in the pivot table csv
    pivot <- read.csv("pivot_tables/i_am_always_busy_at_comx.csv")

    # Create heirarchies of response order, employee type
    resp_order <- c("Strongly.disagree", "Disagree", "Neither.agree.nor.disagree", "Agree", "Strongly.agree")
    heirarchy <- c("Director", "Consultant", "HR", "Admin")

    # Gather the pivot table into long format
    pivot_gather <- pivot %>%
        select(2:7) %>%
        gather(Response, Score, Strongly.disagree:Strongly.agree) %>%
        mutate(Response = factor(Response, levels = resp_order)) %>%
        mutate(Role = factor(what_type_of_employee_are_you, levels = heirarchy))

    # Create the plot
    ggplot(pivot_gather, aes(x = Role, y = Score, fill = Response)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
        scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") + 
        theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + 
        ggtitle("I am always busy at comX")

OVERALL QUESTION COMPARISON


To see which questions get the worst score overall I can plot them on a
horizontal bar chart, ordering the bars and colouring them according to
the score:

    survey_total_q <- survey_cond_num %>%
    select(1:5) %>%
        summarise_all(funs(mean(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
        gather("question","mean_score") %>%
        na.omit(TRUE) %>%
        arrange(desc(mean_score))

    ggplot(survey_total_q, aes(x = reorder(question,-mean_score), y = mean_score, fill = mean_score)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        coord_flip() +
        theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
        scale_fill_continuous(low = "#E33235", high = "#2183EB") +
        theme(legend.position="none") +
        ylab("`Mean Likert Score")

  {IMAGE}


I can also break those bars down by which employee groups contribute
most of the score for that question:

    survey_total_job <- survey_cond_num %>%
        select(1:5) %>%
        group_by(what_type_of_employee_are_you) %>%
        na.omit(TRUE) %>%
        summarise_all(funs(sum)) %>%
        gather("question","total_score") %>%
        mutate(what_type_of_employee_are_you = strrep(c("Director", "Consultant", "HR", "Admin"), times = 1)) %>%
        group_by(question, what_type_of_employee_are_you) %>%
        filter(question != "Role") %>%
        arrange(desc(total_score))

    ggplot(survey_total_job[order(survey_total_job$total_score, decreasing = T),],
                 aes(x = reorder(question,total_score), y = total_score, fill = what_type_of_employee_are_you)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        coord_flip() + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
        scale_fill_brewer(limits = heirarchy, palette = "Dark2") +
        scale_x_discrete(limits = as.vector(survey_total_q$question)) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
                    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
        guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Role")) +
        xlab("Total Likert Score")

  {IMAGE}


Finally, I can get a general sense of the satisfaction of each employee
by seeing the total score given by that employee:

    role_total <- survey_cond_num %>%
        select(1:5) %>%
        replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
        group_by(what_type_of_employee_are_you) %>%
        summarise_all(funs(sum)) %>%
        mutate(sum = rowSums(.[2:length(.)]))

    ggplot(role_total, aes(x = what_type_of_employee_are_you, y = sum, fill = what_type_of_employee_are_you)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        ylab("Total Likert Score") +
        scale_x_discrete(limits = heirarchy) +
        guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Role")) +
        scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

UPDATE 27TH OCT. 2017


I ended up doing a bit more with survey data for an undergraduate
dissertation student that was looking at how gender affected thoughts
towards sustainable activity within the home, and how work was
partitioned in different types of household.

One of the best methods we came up with for graphically representing
correlations in responses to certain questions and the demographic
category a person fit into was the bubble plot. I guess if you wanted to
statistically analyse this data you would use a chi-squared test.

The fake data for the plot below can be found [here][6] and a lookup
table for the contents of each question column can be found [here][7].
The data .csv shows each row as a respondent, along with how many hours
of housework they do, their gender, the codes for checkboxes they ticked
of different sustainable activities they did, related to waste
management and water management, and lastly a self-evaluated measure of
how much they consider sustainable actions in their day to day life.

  [6]: https://johngodlee.github.io/files/likert/sust_behaviour.csv
  [7]: https://johngodlee.github.io/files/likert/question_lookup.csv

So I want to make a bubble plot of age vs. how often people think about
sustainable activities (sustainability_daily_think):

First, make a summary data frame which counts the number of occurrences
of each unique x y combination:

    # Load data
    sust_data <- read.csv("sust_behaviour.csv")

    # Make summary
    sust_bubble <- sust_data %>%
        group_by(age, sustainability_daily_think) %>%
        tally()

Then make the plot:

    ggplot(sust_bubble, aes(x = age, y = sustainability_daily_think)) +
        geom_point(aes(size = n))

  {IMAGE}


Another thing I managed to crack was how to make a diverging bar chart
in ggplot2, so it looks similar to the ones you can make with the [HH
package].

  [HH package]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HH/index.html

Get set up, import data etc.:

    # Packages
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyr)
    library(RColorBrewer)
    library(R.utils)
    library(tidytext)
    library(wordcloud)

    # setwd to source file
    setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

    # Load data 
    sust_data <- read.csv("sust_behaviour.csv")
    question_lookup <- read.csv("question_lookup.csv")

    # Make ordered factor
    sust_data$sustainability_daily_think <- factor(sust_data$sustainability_daily_think, 
        levels=c("Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often", "All the time"), 
        ordered=TRUE)

    # Remove NAs 
    sust_data <- sust_data[!is.na(sust_data$sustainability_daily_think),]

Manipulate the data so it’s ready for plotting:

    # Create a summary dataframe of likert responses to a single question
    sust_think_summ <- sust_data %>%
        group_by(gender, sustainability_daily_think) %>%
        tally() %>%
        mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
        dplyr::select( -n) %>%
        group_by(gender) %>%
        spread(sustainability_daily_think, perc)

    sust_think_summ_hi_lo <- sust_think_summ %>%
        mutate(midlow = Sometimes / 2,
                     midhigh = Sometimes / 2) %>%
        dplyr::select(gender, Never, Rarely, midlow, midhigh, Often, `All the time`) %>%
        gather(key = gender, value = perc) %>%
        `colnames<-`(c("gender", "response", "perc"))


    # Split data into high and low groups
    sust_think_summ_hi <- sust_think_summ_hi_lo %>%
        filter(response %in% c("All the time", "Often", "midhigh")) %>%
        mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("All the time", "Often", "midhigh")))

    sust_think_summ_lo <- sust_think_summ_hi_lo %>%
        filter(response %in% c("midlow", "Rarely", "Never")) %>%
        mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Never", "Rarely", "midlow")))

Construct the plot:

    # Define colour palette and associate with locations
    legend_pal <- brewer.pal(name = "RdBu", n = 5)
    legend_pal <- insert(legend_pal, ats = 3, legend_pal[3])
    legend_pal <- gsub("#F7F7F7", "#9C9C9C", legend_pal)
    names(legend_pal) <- c("All the time", "Often", "midhigh", "midlow", "Rarely", "Never" )

    # Make plot
    ggplot() + 
        geom_bar(data=sust_think_summ_hi, aes(x = gender, y=perc, fill = response), stat="identity") +
        geom_bar(data=sust_think_summ_lo, aes(x = gender, y=-perc, fill = response), stat="identity") + 
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color =c("black")) + 
        scale_fill_manual(values = legend_pal, 
            breaks = c("All the time", "Often", "midhigh", "Rarely", "Never"),
            labels = c("All the time", "Often", "Sometimes", "Rarely", "Never")) +
        coord_flip() + 
        labs(x = "Gender", y = "Percentage of respondents (%)") + 
        ggtitle(question_lookup$survey_question[question_lookup$column_title == "sustainability_daily_think"]) +
        theme_classic()
