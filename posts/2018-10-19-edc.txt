TITLE: What I carry in my bag everyday

I’ve recently been getting into the [EDC subreddit] where people
post photos of what they carry with them everyday, to deal with
mundane everyday things. Inspired, I thought I would write about
what I carry on a normal workday. I cycle to work about 20 minutes
across town. I do most of my work in front of a computer.

First is the big stuff. I have a Quiksilver backpack. I wish I knew
what model, but I’ve had it so long that the label has come off. I
have my Macbook Pro 13" mid-2014 model which I keep in a felt case
with a pad of A4 lined paper and a charger. I have a basic D-lock
with cable and a helmet for my bike.

Then the small stuff. I have a length of cord where I keep my house
and bike keys on keyrings, a 128 gb Samsung USB stick, and a
triangular bin key for dumpster diving. I have some [JVC Adjustable
Ear Clip earphones] which I really like, I’ve had two pairs so
far, over the course of 6 years. I have a 500 ml metal water flask,
a cotton pouch for small change, a Parker mechanical pencil, an
empty tupperware, a spoon, a wallet clip that I made out of bits of
roofing tin, a basic swiss army knife, and because it’s getting
colder now, lip salve. Additionally, when I emptied out my bag
today, I found a piece of [King Alfreds’ Cake], a fungus that is
good for firelighting and carrying embers. It’s very common on the
Ash trees near my parents house, which is where I imagine I picked
it up. I can’t remember when I got it, so it’s probably been in
there for a few years.
