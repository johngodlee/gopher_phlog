Task management macros in Vim - [2019-05-25]
==============================================

I’m slowly trying to emulate parts of the [Emacs Org-mode syntax].
Particularly, when I write TODO lists, having [ ] or [*] at the
beginning of a line to indicate whether that task is ‘pending’ or
‘done’, respectively. I’m not ready to dive straight into a Vim Org-mode
plugin, but I have started to write little functions to make editing the
files slightly more efficient. One such keybinding is simply to toggle
whether a task is marked as ‘done’ or ‘pending’:

  [Emacs Org-mode syntax]: https://orgmode.org/guide/

    " Toggle task as done
    autocmd Filetype text,markdown nnoremap <Leader>D :call ToggleTask()<CR>

    function! ToggleTask()
        if (getline('.') =~ '^\[\*\]')>0      " If you find [*] at line start
            .s/^\[\*\]/[ ]/g
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\[\ \]')>0  " OR If you find [ ] at line start
            .s/^\[\ \]/[*]/g
        else                                  " OR if neither
            echom 'Not a task line'
        endif
    endfunction

The keybinding applies to text and markdown files and is called by
<Leader>d. This calls a function named ToggleTask(). The function
searches the current cursor line to see if it contains [*] and if it
does, replaces it with [ ], then if [*] isn’t found it does the
opposite, searching for [ ] and changing it to [*], finally if neither
of the abov regexes are matched, a message echom is displayed stating
that the cursor line is not a task.

Similarly, I have the line below which makes a line a task line simply
by prepending it with [ ]:

    autocmd Filetype text,markdown nnoremap <Leader>T :s/^/[ ] /g <CR>

These aren’t perfect by any stretch, it would be nicer to roll the whole
lot into a more intelligent single function that can toggle between ‘not
a task’, ‘task to do’, ‘finished task’, that would also take into
account common line prefixes like enumerated lists.



UPDATE - 2019_06_06


I did what I said I would do and rolled it all into one function:

    " Create and toggle done status of task lines
    autocmd Filetype text,markdown nnoremap <Leader>z :call ToggleTask()<CR>

    function! ToggleTask()
        if (getline('.') =~ '^\[x\]')>0       " IF you find [x] at line start
            .s/^\[x\]/[ ]/g
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\[\ \]')>0  " OR if you find [ ] at line start
            .s/^\[\ \]/[x]/g
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\d\+\.\ \[\ \]')>0  " OR if the line begins with 1. [ ]
            .s/\[\ \]/[x]/g
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\d\+\.\ \[x\]')>0  " OR if the line begins with 1. [x]
            .s/\[x\]/[ ]/g
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\d\+\.')>0  " OR if the line begins with a 1.
            .s/\d\+\./& [ ]/
        elseif (getline('.') =~ '^\*\|-')>0   " OR if the line begins with a * or -
            .s/^\*\|-/[ ]/
        else                                  " OR if none
            .s/^/[ ] /g
        endif
    endfunction
