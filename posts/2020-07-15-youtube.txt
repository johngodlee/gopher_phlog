TITLE: How I cast Youtube videos to the TV

I’ve seen other people using a Chromecast and an Android phone to
play Youtube videos on their TV. I wanted to do the same thing but
instead I wanted to use my laptop. It turns out this is pretty
difficult without using Google Chrome. I have since come up with a
system which works reasonably well.

I use [Qutebrowser] as my web browser. I configured qutebrowser to
pipe videos to [VLC] using this keybinding in my
~/.qutebrowser/config.py:

  [Qutebrowser]: https://qutebrowser.org/
  [VLC]: https://www.videolan.org/vlc

    config.bind(',m', 'hint --rapid links spawn open -a VLC.app {hint-url}')

This allows me to press ,m while on a youtube page which displays
thumbnails for videos, then select a video, which opens VLC and
plays the video. This gets rid of any adverts.

To pipe the video to my Chromecast I can use the menu bar in VLC to
select “Playback” -> “Renderer”, then my Chromecast, which is listed
as an option if both are on the same local network.

To adjust the volume on the chromecast I use [go-cast] from the
terminal:

  [go-cast]: https://github.com/barnybug/go-cast

    cast -name "CHROMECAST NAME" volume 0.6
