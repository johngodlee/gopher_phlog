Converting a bank .csv statement to ledger - [2018-08-12]
===========================================================

I use [ledger] to keep track of my expenses and for a long time I
had to manually copy in all my expenses manually from the csv output
that my bank provides of my transactions. Then recently I read about
ledger convert which can take a csv file and convert it to the ledger
journal format.

  [ledger]: https://www.ledger-cli.org/

My bank’s csv format looks like this:


    Date, Type, Description, Value, Balance, Account Name, Account Number

    10/08/2018,POS,"'1062 09AUG18 C , TESCO STORES ",-11.68,6355.61,"'STUDENT ACCOUNT","'260204-20408582",
    10/08/2018,POS,"'1062 09AUG18 C , SAINSBURYS S/MKTS , GB",-3.80,2367.29,"'STUDENT ACCOUNT","'260204-20408582",
    10/08/2018,POS,"'1062 09AUG18 C , WINES , NTMG GB",-17.00,2371.09,"'STUDENT ACCOUNT","'260204-20408582",
    10/08/2018,POS,"'1062 09AUG18 , MOBILE APP  ",-30.00,2388.09,"'STUDENT ACCOUNT","'260204-20408582",

Notice that there are blank lines above and below the header row, so
that is one of the first things to deal with.

I can fix the file with a few sed commands, noting that I use the
macOS version of sed rather than gnused:

    sed -i "" '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $1

    sed -i "" '/\d{4}\s\d{2}\D{3}\d{2}(\sC\s)?\s?,\s/g' $1

    sed -i "" '1s/.*/date,,payee,amount,,,/' $1

The first command removed any lines that are blank or contain spaces,
which gets rid of the empty header lines. The second line removes
some useless filler text in the notes column of the csv file, so for
instance, ,"'1062 09AUG18 C , TESCO STORES ", gets contracted to
,"TESCO STORES ",. Finally, the header row is replaced with headers
which ledger convert recognises.

ledger convert needs some inputs:

-   --input-date-format "%d/%m/%Y" tells ledger convert the format of
    the date column in the csv file.
-   --account assets:bank:student_acc denotes the bank account the
    csv file is for.
-   --rich-data extracts unnamed columns from the csv and adds them
    as notes to each ledger entry.
-   -f ~/.ledger.journal denotes the path to the ledger journal file
    to use for reference.
-   --invert inverts the sign of the transactions, which I have to do
    for this style of csv to stop ledger thinking that expenses are
    incomes and vice versa.

Then I can wrap all of this into a neat shell script which takes
inputs of the input csv and output ledger journal:

    #!/bin/bash

    touch $2

    sed -i "" '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $1

    sed -i "" '/\d{4}\s\d{2}\D{3}\d{2}(\sC\s)?\s?,\s/g' $1

    sed -i "" '1s/.*/date,,payee,amount,,,/' $1

    ledger convert $1 --input-date-format "%d/%m/%Y" --account assets:bank:student_acc --invert --rich-data -f ~/.ledger.journal > $2

For now, I’ll copy in the compiled journal entries manually, I don’t
want to accidentally copy over my existing journal file by writing
directly to it.

It’s not a perfect system, I still have to manually fill in the type
of expense in the ledger journal, but I really don’t see any way
around that as my expenses don’t come from a finite list of sources,
so categorising all of them would be impossible.



UPDATE 2019_08_26


I had some problems with CSV files from one of my accounts. It turns
out they were being stupid with the CSV formatting and had open
double quotes which weren’t closed in a description field, meaning
that any commas in that field were interpreted as column delimiters.
I took it as an excuse to improve the ledger convert bash scripts I’d
set up previously. I wanted to clean them up and use some shell
scripting techniques I’ve learned since last year when I wrote the
original script.

    #!/bin/bash

    # Make temp. file
    temp=$(mktemp)

    # Format file depending on account
    if [ "$2" = "assets:bank:student" ] || [ "$2" = "assets:bank:isa" ] || [ "$2" = "assets:bank:res" ]
    then
        # Prepare file
        ## Remove blank lines | Replace column headers | Remove single quotes > send to temp
        sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $1 | sed '1s/.*/date,,payee,amount,,,/' | sed "s/'//" > $temp
        date="%d/%m/%Y"

    elif [ "$2" = "assets:bank:monzo" ]
    then
        echo "TEST"
        # Prepare file
        ## Replace column headers | Change tag | Remove time from date > send to temp
        sed '1s/.*/transid,date,amount,,,,payee,,,,,/' $1 | sed 's/general/misc/g' | sed 's/T[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]Z//g' > $temp
        date="%Y-%m-%d"

    else
        echo "Choose an account"
        echo "  assets:bank:student"
        echo "  assets:bank:isa"
        echo "  assets:bank:res"
        echo "  assets:bank:monzo"
    fi

    # Run ledger
    ledger convert $temp --input-date-format ${date} --account $2 --invert --rich-data --auto-match -f ~/.ledger.journal

    # Remove temp
    rm ${temp}

I combined the scripts I had for my two banks into one, hinging on an
if-else statement acting on the account name given as an argument to
the script. It first cleans up the csv files and saves them to a
$temp file, then runs ledger convert with certain options and sends
output to STDOUT.
