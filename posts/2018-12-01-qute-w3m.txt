Converting Qutebrowser bookmarks to w3m bookmarks - [2018-12-01]
==================================================================

I use [Qutebrowser] as my primary web browser, but I also really like
using [w3m] for super fast text-based browsing when I’m working mostly
in the terminal. As a bit of practice in writing bash scripts, I figured
I would try to write a script which constructed a w3m style
bookmark.html from my Qutebrowser formatted bookmarks/urls and
quickmarks, because confusingly, Qutebrowser uses two files for
bookmarks, with different formatting. This is what I came up with:

  [Qutebrowser]: https://qutebrowser.org/
  [w3m]: http://w3m.sourceforge.net/

    #!/bin/bash

    touch ~/.w3m/bookmark.html

    echo "<html><head><title>Bookmarks</title></head>
    <body>
    <h1>Quickmarks</h1>
    <ul>" > ~/.w3m/bookmark.html

    while read line; do
        if [[ $line != *"qute"* ]]; then
            url=$(echo $line | sed 's@.* @@')
            desc=$(echo $line | sed 's/\(.*\) .*/\1/') 
            echo "<li><a href=\"$url\">$desc</a>" >> ~/.w3m/bookmark.html
        fi
    done < ~/.qutebrowser/quickmarks 

    echo "</ul>" >> ~/.w3m/bookmark.html

    echo "<h1>Other bookmarks</h1>
    <ul>" >> ~/.w3m/bookmark.html

    while read line; do
        if [[ $line != *"qute"* ]]; then
            url=$(echo $line | cut -d " " -f 1) 
            desc=$(echo ${line#* }) 
            echo "<li><a href=\"$url\">$desc</a>" >> ~/.w3m/bookmark.html
        fi
    done < ~/.qutebrowser/bookmarks/urls 

    echo "</ul>
    </body>
    </html>" >> ~/.w3m/bookmark.html

Firstly it creates a new bookmark.html, then echos some preamble HTML,
then loops through each line of quickmarks then urls, cutting the line
into the URL and the description of that URL, and forwards it to
bookmark.html, then it puts in the footer HTML material. Importantly, it
doesn’t include any bookmarks with the string qute in them, which all
refer to Qutebrowser only special URIs, it does this with an if
statement if [[ $line != *"qute"* ]]; then.

In w3m, I can then open bookmark.html with Esc-b.

For the record, .qutebrowser/bookmarks/urls looks like this:
