TITLE: Compressing images for this website

====================================================================


I wanted my webpages to load faster, and I was somewhat inspired by
[this website] which runs entirely on a solar powered raspberry
pi. They needed to minimize the amount of data transfer to keep
energy usage down. I was also inspired a bit by this [blog post]
on their image dithering procedure which converts images to black
and white while preserving the essence of what the image is trying
to portray. Unfortunately they do their image conversion in Adobe
Photoshop, which I didn’t want to use. Instead I decided to see if I
could replicate their conversion process and achieve highly
compressed dithered images using [ImageMagick], which could be
written into a reproducible script that I could run on a set of
images. I also wanted to see if there was a better method of
compressing the images.

  [ImageMagick]:

ImageMagick runs on the command line and the command I use is
convert which is designed to take an image, alter it in a multitude
of ways, then save to a new file. mogrify is better for overwriting
the same image.

I have an [example image here] which is currently 6.8 MB.


y first pass at the image is simply to reduce the -quality of the
image, which takes a percentage value that pertains to the
compression level.

    convert bike.jpg -quality 90% output_1.jpg

This produces an image of 3.3 MB.

Here is a plot of the file size as the -quality percentage is
reduced. and a table of file sizes. Note that 100% compression on
the original image actually made the original image of 6.8 MB
larger, to 7.8 MB.

  {IMAGE}


  Compression (%)   Size (MB)
  ----------------- -----------
  100               7.799
  95                4.479
  90                3.229
  85                2.6
  80                2.24
  75                1.973
  70                1.808
  65                1.658
  60                1.531
  55                1.434
  50                1.349
  45                1.268
  40                1.172
  35                1.086
  30                0.9793
  25                0.8683
  20                0.7416
  15                0.5998
  10                0.4374
  5                 0.2395
  —————–            ————

It’s interesting that even at 5% -quality, the image is still not
bad to look at.

For the next part I’ll take an arbitrary -quality value of 50%,
meaning the base image is 1.349 MB.

Converting the image to grayscale makes the file slightly smaller,
but not much

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray output_21.jpg

The original image was 1,414,879 bytes (1.349 MB) and the grayscale
image is 1,325,856 (1.264 MB), a difference of 89,023 bytes, or 87
KB.

I also experimented with other options for reducing the colors, but
none of these made any positive difference. -posterize 4 = 1.781 MB,
-quantize gray = 1.349 MB.

Next I want to dither the image to hopefully save even more file
size. I’ll use the grayscale image I generated earlier, which is
1.264 MB. There are multiple options for dithering so here is a
comparison.

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -dither floyd-steinberg output_25.jpg

Both methods produced files of exactly the same size as the grascale
image so I think I’m doing something wrong. I think I should apply
some sort of dithering color reduction flag as well. Here are
examples with different color reduction methods:

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -dither floyd-steinberg -monochrome output_26.jpg

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -dither floyd-steinberg -posterize 10 output_27.jpg

The -monochrome option produced a file of 2.812 MB and the
-posterize 10 option produced a file of 1.428 MB.

Posterize is an interesting one to play with. Here is a comparison
of -posterize with different numbers of colours:

  Size (MB)   Number of colours
  ----------- -------------------
  1.428       10
  1.459       9
  1.487       8
  1.532       7
  1.578       6
  1.631       5
  1.674       4
  1.793       3
  1.437       2
  0.06754     1
  ———–        ——————-

Weirdly, the file size actually increases as the number of colours
decreases, up until the number of colours is two.

There are also predefined dithering threshold maps that can be used
with -ordered-dither:

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -ordered-dither c7x7w output_43.jpg

Here is a comparison of these methods:

  {IMAGE}


  Code     Description                 Size (MB)
  -------- --------------------------- -----------
  checks   Checkerboard 2x1 (dither)   2.678
  o2x2     Ordered 2x2 (dispersed)     3.702
  o3x3     Ordered 3x3 (dispersed)     4.445
  o4x4     Ordered 4x4 (dispersed)     4.557
  o8x8     Ordered 8x8 (dispersed)     4.675
  h6x6a    Halftone 6x6 (angled)       4.824
  h8x8a    Halftone 8x8 (angled)       1.264
  h6x6o    Halftone 6x6 (orthogonal)   4.877
  h8x8o    Halftone 8x8 (orthogonal)   4.831
  c5x5b    Circles 5x5 (black)         4.879
  c5x5w    Circles 5x5 (white)         4.879
  c6x6b    Circles 6x6 (black)         4.831
  c6x6w    Circles 6x6 (white)         4.823
  c7x7b    Circles 7x7 (black)         4.915
  c7x7w    Circles 7x7 (white)         4.899
  ——–      —————————                   ———–

So the h8x8a method produced the smallest file size of 1.264 MB, but
this is only as small as the undithered grayscale image!

So from my little test so far it seems that the best way of
compressing images is to use a grayscale undithered image an adjust
the -quality of the image to my liking.

Here are a few other options to reduce file size I came across. Here
is a comparison using the undithered grayscale image.

Removing EXIF data, which I would probably want to do regardless of
the file size, just for privacy reasons:

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -strip output_54.jpg

This reduces the file size from 1.264 MB to 1.242 MB, a difference
of 23.2 KB.

Adding some Gaussian blur to reduce the detail level:

    convert bike.jpg -quality 50% -colorspace gray -strip -gaussian-blur 0.05 output_54.jpg

This reduces the stripped grayscale image from 1.242 MB to 1.031 MB,
a difference of 215 KB.

Here is a comparison of images converted with different levels of
gaussian blur.

One thing I did find was that the computation time increased with
the radius of the blur.

  Blur   Size (MB)
  ------ -----------
  0.05   1.031
  0.1    1.031
  0.2    1.031
  0.3    1.031
  0.4    1.031
  0.5    1.031
  0.6    1.031
  0.7    1.031
  0.8    1.031
  0.9    1.031
  1      1.031
  2      0.9472
  3      0.9377
  4      0.9373
  5      0.9373
  10     0.9373
  20     0.9373
  30     0.9373
  40     0.9373
  50     0.9373

So, finally, the optimal way of compressing my JPEG images seems to
be:

    convert bike.jpg -quality 20% -colorspace gray -strip -gaussian-blur 3.5 output.jpg

This leads to an image of 538 KB. It looks good, except when zooming
in, then it gets a bit hairy, this is where dithering might become
useful if I can find a way of dithering while maintaining the small
size of the image.

Another thing I learned from reading the comments on [this
website] was that JPEG is the most appropriate format for reducing
image file size as it is lossy, unlike PNG, so I can convert all my
PNG images to JPEG using:

  [this website]: https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/

    convert test.png -background white -flatten output.jpg

-background white -flatten is needed to allow the JPEG to properly
display the transparent areas of the JPG as white background.

I have a folder on my website with images sorted into directories
based on what blog post they refer to. I wrote this shell script to
prepare the images to be put onto the website:

    #!/bin/bash

    shopt -s nullglob

    # For each image
    for i in img_full/*/*.{jpg,JPG,jpeg,png,PNG}; do

        # If the directory in the compressed images directory doesn't exist, create it
        new_dir=$(dirname ${i} | sed "s/img_full/img/g")

        if [ ! -d $new_dir ]; then
            mkdir -p $new_dir;
        fi

        echo $dir

        # Create new file path for output
        new_path=$(echo "${i}" | sed "s/img_full/img/g")

        echo $new_path

        # Convert image files
        if [ ! -f $new_path ]; then
            convert $i -quality 20% -colorspace gray -strip -background white -flatten -gaussian-blur 3.5 $new_path 
        fi

    done

    # Maintain full size 404 image 
    cp img_full/404/404.png img/404/404.png
