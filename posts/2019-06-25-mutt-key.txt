Fetching mail with offlineimap within Mutt - [2019-06-25]
===========================================================

I wanted to be able to press a key in mutt which would run offlineimap
in the background to get new messages, then ask Mutt to put them on
screen. This line goes in my .muttrc:

    macro index,pager @ "<enter-command>unset wait_key<enter><shell-escape>offlineimap -o -u quiet &<enter><sync-mailbox>" "Run offlineimap"

It defines a macro which can be run in the index or the pager of mutt by
pressing the @ key.

First it stops mutt from asking the user to press any key to continue
once the shell command is finished.

Next it invokes offlineimap in the background (&). Then afterwards it
syncs mutt with its mailboxes (:sync-mailbox).
