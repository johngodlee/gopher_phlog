By siphoning them, I got to try most of the demijohns. They certainly
had different flavours, some were more flavourful than others, but
hopefully they will mature into interesting ciders.

Sterilising the bottles took the majority of the time. We took the
approach of rinsing with hot water, shaking some sterilising fluid
(campden tablets dissolved in water) thoroughly in each bottle, then
rinsing with cold water.

I think we should leave the bottles for another couple of months before
we start drinking in earnest, as with previous experience I’ve found
that they get better over time.

We also made a mixture bottle of everything that spilled out of the
demijohns into the bucket. Mega-mix Volume I.
