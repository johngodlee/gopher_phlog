Ubuntu network timeout - [2019-04-10]
=======================================

I installed a minimal Ubuntu server image on a little Toshiba NB100
netbook I was given as a present and there was an annoying side effect
whereby if a wireless network wasn’t detected on boot the bootup process
would wait for about 5 minutes looking for a network before moving on.
This happened every single time I booted up because I preferred to only
search for wireless networks manually. The answer was to edit the
networking.service config file:

    sudo systemctl edit networking.service

Then enter into the file:

    [Service]
    TimeoutStartSec=20sec

to set the timeout period when looking for wireless networks to be 20
seconds.

Check the file has the correct information:

    systemctl cat networking.service
