TITLE: Sort and filter .bib files

====================================================================


I have a master .bib file called lib.bib, which contains all the
BibTeX citations I’ve ever used. I use it as an index for organising
which papers I’ve read and it means it’s easier to reuse references
for new manuscripts. When I submit a manuscript to a journal
however, I want to include a standalone .bib file which only
contains the references for the current manuscript. I wrote a little
shell script which leverages [ripgrep (rg)] to create a sorted and
filtered .bib file:

  [ripgrep (rg)]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

    #!/usr/bin/env sh

    # $1 = .tex file to find citations 
    # $2 = .bib file to grab entries

    match=($(rg -o '\\cite.*?\{.*?\}' $1 | sed -E "s/\\\\cite.*?\{(.*)\}/\1/g" | sed 's/,\s\+/\n/g' | sort | uniq))

    for i in "${match[@]}"; do 
        rg -N --color never --multiline --multiline-dotall "\{$i.*?^\}" $2
    done 

The script takes two arguments, the first is a .tex file which is
searched to find all instances or \citep{.*}, \citealt{.*} etc., the
second is a .bib file which is used to grab the references found in
the .tex file.

Going line by line, first I create an array variable which contains
all the BibTeX reference keys from the .tex file. It sorts these
entries alphabetically and removes duplicates to create a tidy list.
Next I loop over the array variable and search for each BibTeX entry
in the .bib file, which is then printed to stdout so the user can do
what they want with it, usually send to a new .bib file.
