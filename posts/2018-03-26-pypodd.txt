I’ve been working on and off since around Summer last year, making a
simplistic command line podcast catching app. I had a go with lots
of other podcatchers: [upodder], [greg], [podcatcher] and
others that I can’t remember, but I found them to be just a bit
overblown, and many had difficulty when RSS feeds were constructed
with certain types of formatting. So while I was on trying to learn
Python I set myself the task of writing a little app.

  [podcatcher]: https://github.com/doga/podcatcher

In the end, it only took 120 lines of code, which I think is quite
good, though it doesn’t do anything fancy like let you store
databases of played episodes, it just lists podcasts through a
heirarchical menu system and lets you download them one at a time.

        else:
            raw_input("Invalid choice, press Enter to try again...")

So basically, it’s just a set of if statements linked to the value
of user input variables, all wrapped in a big while loop so it
continues to return to the first level menu unless you tell it to
exit.

The structure goes like this, where each number refers to a menu
requiring user input:

    1. Choose a podcast to download
    │
    └─2. Choose an episode to download, most recent or another
      │  
      ├─Most Recent
      │ │
      │ └─Downloading most recent episode
      └─Another 
        │
        └─3. Choose a specific episode to download
          │
          └─Download the specific episode
