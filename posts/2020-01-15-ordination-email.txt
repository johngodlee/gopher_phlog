TITLE: An email about ordination and environmental fits

====================================================================


I got an email from a colleague asking for my opinion on analysing
the environmental determinants of tree species diversity measured in
multiple plots across a province in their country. I did a load of
reading on this sort of thing about 6 months ago so I relied heavily
on my notes to write a response and also provide an R script with my
recommendations.

The original email, paraphrased slightly, said:

  Dear John

  I need your help with diversity analysis in R for my masters
  student. Our goal is to detect relations between environmental
  variables and diversity.

  All variables are numeric, we would like to know what kind of
  analysis you suggest?

  Ordinations? Regressions? PCA? NMDS?

  Can you guide Us?

They also sent a document with their overall research goal:

  Evaluate and relate by statistical analysis the effect of soil,
  climate and topography on the spatial distribution of diversity
  (Richness index Shannon index and Simpson index ) of vegetation in
  province.

y email response was:

  My preference for an ordination technique to analyse variation in
  species composition is NMDS. This is for two main reasons. The
  first is that NMDS deals well with instances where there are no
  shared species between two sites, which I imagine may happen a lot
  in your very large dataset, across a wide geographical area.
  Because Principle Co-ordinate Analysis (PCoA) is an eigenvalue
  analysis and must find a unique solution, when two or more sites
  share no common data, this unique solution cannot be found. The
  second reason is that in contrast to Principle Component Analysis
  (PCA), NMDS can properly represent variation in species abundances
  because it is not limited to using a euclidean distance method. I
  would recommend using the Bray-Curtis distance method.

  I don’t think it is wise to use all the environmental variables in
  the NMDS, especially because as you have shown, some of the
  variables are highly correlated. I think you should choose
  variables which you think have a valid ecological reason for
  influencing the species composition.

  In addition to investigating how species composition (species
  identity and relative abundance) varies with environmental
  variables, you may wish to investigate how species diversity
  (species richness and abundance evenness) varies with
  environmental variables. To do this, I would use a simple general
  linear model with multiple environmental variables as the
  predictor variables and the Shannon index as the response
  variable.

  I don’t have your dataset so I have provided in an attached R
  script the way I would perform this sort of analysis in R, using
  an example dataset provided in the {vegan} R package which I hope
  is similar to your data.

The R script I sent looked like this:

    # Import data 
    data(dune)
    ##' Site (rows) by species (columns) abundance matrix
    ##' 20 sites
    ##' 30 species 

    env <- read.csv("env.csv")
    ##' Dataframe with environmental variables for each of the 20 sites
    ##' This is fake data I created for this example

    # Define a function to estimate the optimal number of dimensions for an NMDS
    NMDS.scree <- function(x) {
      plot(rep(1, 10), replicate(10, metaMDS(x, autotransform = F, k = 1)$stress), 
        xlim = c(1, 10),ylim = c(0, 0.30), 
        xlab = "# of Dimensions", ylab = "Stress", main = "NMDS stress plot")
      for (i in 1:10) {
        points(rep(i + 1,10), 
          replicate(10, metaMDS(x, autotransform = F, k = i + 1)$stress)
        )
      }
    }

    # Run NMDS.scree 
    NMDS.scree(dune)
    ##' The scree plot shows that 3 dimensions produces a stress value below 0.1,
    ##' which is indicates that with this many dimensions, the NMDS provides a good
    ##' representation of the difference in species composition.

    # Run NMDS with 3 dimensions
    dune_nmds <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", try = 500, trymax = 500, k = 3, 
      autotransform = FALSE)

    # Assess the fit of the NMDS with a stressplot (Shepard plot)
    stressplot(dune_nmds)
    ##' The stressplot shows a strong positive correlation
    ##' It plots the distances among objects in the ordination plot against the 
    ##' original Bray-Curtis distances. A tight positive correlation between 
    ##' original distance and transformed distance shows that the dimensionality 
    ##' reduction was successful.

    # Extract final stress value of the NMDS
    nmdsstress <- dune_nmds$stress
    ##' Should be quoted in results, to show validity of results of NMDS

    # Extract site (plot) scores from NMDS analysis
    plot_scores <- as.data.frame(scores(dune_nmds))

      c("BIO1", "BIO12", "BIO15", "BIO17", "elevation", "sand_coarse")], 
    permutations = 999)
    ##' Note that these aren't my recommendations for the variables you should 
    ##' use on your data, they are just commonly used variables.
